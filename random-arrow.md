**Finers Club** was found under the spirit guidance of the **"PREFACE'**

###### by definition, given from our 'Old James' or Henry James,

an American Master Novelist. In **"What Macie Knew", **James stated:  
**The Preface:**

> **is to criticise, to establish in fine, a relation  
>     with the criticised 'thing' and makes it one's own.**

Honestly, I have not read any of his work. I always knew that **Henry** was **William James**'s brother,  
 that they both were my subjects I found worthwhile to look into, perhaps not now but any chance I get at later time. When first came to the US back in 1991, at 13 years old, I took my first job as a volunteer clerk for a local San Diego Public Library; Reading nor Writing were my favorite subjects at the time, but because "Learning to Speak English" was my only main focus.  
  Not Until after 9/11, that I found myself liking to read. I'd also developed through time, a natural talent   
  in what I called **BSI** or **Book Selective Intelligent**. **BSI** has helped me to  
  be selective with my collection and it is what brought me  
  The **"Orange Flower"** for it's orange hard cover. **\(The book is from Duke University and has been withdrawned\)**  
  Titled **"Art Of The Novel'** by Henry James with an introduction by [Richard Palmer Blackmur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._P._Blackmur)  
  after reading the introduction, I wikied the name "Blackmur"  
  where I discovered his last work **"Primer Ignorance"**,published in **1967**  
Once again, I'd also have not read **PI.**  
  **Have any one out there read PI?**  
What's really entrigue me was not only its title **Primer Ignorance** but a flow of objects  
or things that have recently came to my possesion.

Today is **Oct 04 2017**

Poor News Happened yesterday, the **Las Vegas Mass Shooting**  
The tragic News was over pouring, becomes now the centre topic of our today's talk.  
 But let us take a moment to step back and see.  
 2017 started with **Trump's Election**,  
followed the **Eclipse,** than **Harvey** and now the **\(g\)** ? Well **\(g\)** here could  
be anything. In this case **\(g\)** is for **Gun Control** or scientifically  
speaking **\(g\)** is for **\[Intelligent\]** So. what is all this about,  
What am I really sayin?**  
One may ask**: could it be **Fake News**? Or **It was a bet**?  
  Another might say what is **Las Vegas Mass Shooting** has anything to do with  
 BLACKMUR'S PI? or Henry James's **"Art of the Novel"?**  
  **To answer this Quesion is**

> of considerable consequence, because the whole of rhetoric depends  
>       on this **spacial conceptualization,** especially as it relates to the **Canon of
