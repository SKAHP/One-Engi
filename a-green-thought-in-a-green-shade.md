 A GREEN THOUGHT IN A GREEN SHADE

Fire Testament, by Willard Maas. Alcestis Press, New York.



 Mr. Maas, in working up the simples of his experience to the illusion of total apprehension, employs something like the intellectual machinery of Blake modiied by the influence of Wallace Stevens and his own obsessions, in the medium of a language influenced by Hart Crane, E. E. Cummings and his own verbal predispositions; and the first question to ask about his poetry is, to what degree are the machinery and the language united in inseparable, though distinguishable, warp and woof? The second question is, if they are united, at what expense? If the poems are read through as a whole a small number of words will be seen to recur in positions of qualifying importance. It is these words, as they shift and are shuffled like counters, that compose the machinery of symbolic meaning. As they are particularized in the different poems, and

only so, do they unite the meaning with the poems. These words include various forms of fire and water, trees and leaves, sun and moon, and the colors red, blue, and green

Fire is most often employed as an end-word, a word of ecstasy, and sometimes lacks a precise application. Fire is an ultimate word, the symbol of all consummate things, both the consumer and that which is consumed; and Mr. Maas

may be allowed it as a crowning symbol just so often as he can make it fit. The only trouble with his other principal words is that they are naturally loose as well as common and precise, and when used over-often their looseness over tops their capacity for precision. This is what happens with the word bluc, used by Mr. Maas much as by Wallace Stevens, to represent symbolically the ultimate, the final, the substantial; it comes to seem arbitrary. And this is even more the case with the word green, which appears prominently in nineteen out of the twenty-six pocms; with the increase in symbolic use both the symbolic and the precise senses of the word become attenuated, and we are treated to a blueprint rather than a building of the meaning intended.

**The Blueprint is exciting when we remember what it predicts, but it cannot substitute for the meaning itself. An integrating vocabulary so small seems, as a practical matter, good for a small number of poems and not for a large number; at lcast when the final success depends upon a particular and limited mode of poetry where the words carry a burden of meaning arbitrarily assigned to them. **This is the intellectual mode of mysticism,  the mode where by the sentiment of unity, deployed and its elements dissociated in arbitrary symbols, is made to seem first the experience of unity, and then, by the coercive charm of form \(James phrase\) the emotion of unity. The point is that the mystical insight-self-extinguishing as it is held to beis not itself

a proper object of poetry or any rational art. It is ultimate matter for super-rational discipline. Hence poetry cannot give the insight; but it can give, can represent in the most nearly actual form of which imagination is capable, the elements and as it were the substance of the experience in which

\[114\]

that insight terminates. And this is the light, self-illuminating and self-restricting, in which to look at Mr. Maas poetry: looking to see what is there in that reality which, as it exists, every technical device must buttress and sustain, and from which other realities, if ever, must spring. There is, in this poet, a good deal, and as he enlarges his vocabulary

there will be more. The reality sought for is found only

through the reality and richness of language on the repre-

sentative level
