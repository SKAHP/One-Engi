** A GREEN THOUGHT IN A GREEN SHADE**

Fire Testament, by Willard Maas. Alcestis Press, New York.

Mr. Maas, in working up the simples of his experience to the illusion of total apprehension, employs something like the intellectual machinery of Blake modiied by the influence of Wallace Stevens and his own obsessions, in the medium of a language influenced by Hart Crane, E. E. Cummings and his own verbal predispositions; and the first question to ask about his poetry is, to what degree are the machinery and the language united in inseparable, though distinguishable, warp and woof? The second question is, if they are united, at what expense? If the poems are read through as a whole a small number of words will be seen to recur in positions of qualifying importance. It is these words, as they shift and are shuffled like counters, that compose the machinery of symbolic meaning. As they are particularized in the different poems, and only so, do they unite the meaning with the poems. These words include various forms of fire and water, trees and leaves, sun and moon, and the colors red, blue, and green

Fire is most often employed as an end-word, a word of ecstasy, and sometimes lacks a precise application. Fire is an ultimate word, the symbol of all consummate things, both the consumer and that which is consumed; and Mr. Maas

may be allowed it as a crowning symbol just so often as he can make it fit. The only trouble with his other principal words is that they are naturally loose as well as common and precise, and when used over-often their looseness over tops their capacity for precision. This is what happens with the word bluc, used by Mr. Maas much as by Wallace Stevens, to represent symbolically the ultimate, the final, the substantial; it comes to seem arbitrary. And this is even more the case with the word green, which appears prominently in nineteen out of the twenty-six pocms; with the increase in symbolic use both the symbolic and the precise senses of the word become attenuated, and we are treated to a blueprint rather than a building of the meaning intended.

**The Blueprint is exciting when we remember what it predicts, but it cannot substitute for the meaning itself. An integrating vocabulary so small seems, as a practical matter, good for a small number of poems and not for a large number; at last when the final success depends upon a particular and limited mode of poetry where the words carry a burden of meaning arbitrarily assigned to them.**

# Elegy Xii

COME Fates ; I fear you not ! All whom I owe  
Are paid, but you ; then 'rest me ere I go.  
But Chance from you all sovereignty hath got ;  
Love woundeth none but those whom Death dares not ;  
True if you were, and just in equity,  
I should have vanquish'd her, as you did me ;  
Else lovers should not brave Death's pains, and live ;  
But 'tis a rule, **“ Death comes not to relieve.”**  
Or, pale and wan Death's terrors, are they laid  
So deep in lovers, they make Death afraid ?  
Or—the least comfort—have I company ?  
O'ercame she Fates, Love, Death, as well as me ?  
Yes, Fates do silk unto her distaff pay,  
**For ransom, which tax they on us do lay.**  
Love gives her youth—which is the reason why  
Youths, for her sake, some wither and some die.  
Poor Death can nothing give ; yet, for her sake,  
Still in her turn, he doth a lover take.  
And if Death should prove false, she fears him not ;  
Our Muses, to redeem her, she hath got.  
That fatal night we last kiss'd, I thus pray'd,  
—Or rather, thus despair'd, I should have said—  
**Kisses, and yet despair ! The forbid tree**  
Did promise \(and deceive\) no more than she.  
Like lambs, that see their teats, and must eat hay,  
A food, whose taste hath made me pine away.  
Dives, when thou saw'st bliss, and craved'st to touch  
A drop of water, thy great pains were such.  
**Here grief wants a fresh wit, for mine being spent,  
And my sighs weary, groans are all my rent.  
Unable longer to endure the pain,  
They break like thunder, and do bring down rain.**  
Thus till dry tear solder my eye, I weep ;  
And then, I dream, how you securely sleep,  
And in your dreams do laugh at me. I hate,  
And pray Love all may ; he pities my state,  
**But says, I therein no revenge shall find ;  
The sun would shine, though all the world were blind**.  
Yet, to try my hate, Love show'd me your tear ;  
And I had died, had not your smile been there.  
Your frown undoes me ; your smile is my wealth ;  
And as you please to look, I have my health.  
Methought, Love pitying me, when he saw this,  
Gave me your hands, the backs and palms to kiss.  
That cured me not, but to bear pain gave strength ;  
And what is lost in force, is took in length.  
I call'd on Love again, who fear'd you so,  
That his compassion still proved greater woe ;  
For, then I dream'd I was in bed with you,  
But durst not feel, for fear it should not be true.  
This merits not your anger, had it been ;  
The queen of chastity was naked seen ;  
And in bed not to feel, the pain I took,  
Was more than for Actæon not to look ;  
And that breast which lay ope, I did not know,  
But for the clearness, **from a lump of snow ;**  
Nor that sweet teat which on the top it bore  
From the **rose-bud** which for my sake you wore.  
These griefs to issue forth, by verse I prove ;  
Or turn their course by travel and new love.  
All would not do ; the best at last I tried ;  
Unable longer to hold out, I died.  
And then I found I lost life, death by flying ;  
Who hundreds live, are but so long in dying.  
Charon did let me pass ; I'll him requite.  
**To mark the groves or shades wrongs my delight ;**  
**I'll speak but of those ghosts I found alone,  
Those thousand ghosts, whereof myself made one**,  
All images of thee ; I asked them why ?  
The judge told me, all they for thee did die,  
And therefore had for their Elysian bliss,  
In one another their own loves to kiss.  
O here I miss'd not blissh, but being dead ;  
For lo ! I dreamt, I dreamt, and waking said,  
“ Heaven, if who are in thee there must dwell,  
How is't I now was there, and now I fell ?”

** **This is the intellectual mode of mysticism,  the mode where by the sentiment of unity, deployed and its elements dissociated in arbitrary symbols, is made to seem first the experience of unity, and then, by the coercive charm of form \(James phrase\) the emotion of unity. The point is that the mystical insight-self-extinguishing as it is held to beis not itself **a proper object of poetry or any rational art. It is ultimate matter for super-rational discipline. Hence poetry cannot give the insight; but it can give, can represent in the most nearly actual form of which imagination is capable, the elements and as it were the substance of the experience in which**

\[114\]

**that insight terminates. And this is the light, self-illuminating and self-restricting, in which to look at Mr. Maas poetry: looking to see what is there in that reality which, as it exists, every technical device must buttress and sustain, and from which other realities, if ever, must spring. There is, in this poet, a good deal, and as he enlarges his vocabulary **there will be more. The reality sought for is found only through the reality and richness of language on the \*\*representative level\*\*
