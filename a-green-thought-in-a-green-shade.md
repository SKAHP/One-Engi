** A GREEN THOUGHT IN A GREEN SHADE**

Fire Testament, by Willard Maas. Alcestis Press, New York.

Mr. Maas, in working up the simples of his experience to the illusion of total apprehension, employs something like the intellectual machinery of Blake modiied by the influence of Wallace Stevens and his own obsessions, in the medium of a language influenced by Hart Crane, E. E. Cummings and his own verbal predispositions; and the first question to ask about his poetry is, to what degree are the machinery and the language united in inseparable, though distinguishable, warp and woof? The second question is, if they are united, at what expense? If the poems are read through as a whole a small number of words will be seen to recur in positions of qualifying importance. It is these words, as they shift and are shuffled like counters, that compose the machinery of symbolic meaning. As they are particularized in the different poems, and only so, do they unite the meaning with the poems. These words include various forms of fire and water, trees and leaves, sun and moon, and the colors red, blue, and green

Fire is most often employed as an end-word, a word of ecstasy, and sometimes lacks a precise application. Fire is an ultimate word, the symbol of all consummate things, both the consumer and that which is consumed; and Mr. Maas

may be allowed it as a crowning symbol just so often as he can make it fit. The only trouble with his other principal words is that they are naturally loose as well as common and precise, and when used over-often their looseness over tops their capacity for precision. This is what happens with the word bluc, used by Mr. Maas much as by Wallace Stevens, to represent symbolically the ultimate, the final, the substantial; it comes to seem arbitrary. And this is even more the case with the word green, which appears prominently in nineteen out of the twenty-six pocms; with the increase in symbolic use both the symbolic and the precise senses of the word become attenuated, and we are treated to a blueprint rather than a building of the meaning intended.

**The Blueprint is exciting when we remember what it predicts, but it cannot substitute for the meaning itself. An integrating vocabulary so small seems, as a practical matter, good for a small number of poems and not for a large number; at last when the final success depends upon a particular and limited mode of poetry where the words carry a burden of meaning arbitrarily assigned to them.**

# Elegy Xii

COME Fates ; I fear you not ! All whom I owe  
Are paid, but you ; then 'rest me ere I go.  
But Chance from you all sovereignty hath got ;  
Love woundeth none but those whom Death dares not ;  
True if you were, and just in equity,  
I should have vanquish'd her, as you did me ;  
Else lovers should not brave Death's pains, and live ;  
But 'tis a rule, **“ Death comes not to relieve.”**  
Or, pale and wan Death's terrors, are they laid  
So deep in lovers, they make Death afraid ?  
Or—the least comfort—have I company ?  
O'ercame she Fates, Love, Death, as well as me ?  
Yes, Fates do silk unto her distaff pay,  
**For ransom, which tax they on us do lay.**  
Love gives her youth—which is the reason why  
Youths, for her sake, some wither and some die.  
Poor Death can nothing give ; yet, for her sake,  
Still in her turn, he doth a lover take.  
And if Death should prove false, she fears him not ;  
Our Muses, to redeem her, she hath got.  
That fatal night we last kiss'd, I thus pray'd,  
—Or rather, thus despair'd, I should have said—  
**Kisses, and yet despair ! The forbid tree**  
Did promise \(and deceive\) no more than she.  
Like lambs, that see their teats, and must eat hay,  
A food, whose taste hath made me pine away.  
Dives, when thou saw'st bliss, and craved'st to touch  
A drop of water, thy great pains were such.  
**Here grief wants a fresh wit, for mine being spent,  
And my sighs weary, groans are all my rent.  
Unable longer to endure the pain,  
They break like thunder, and do bring down rain.**  
Thus till dry tear solder my eye, I weep ;  
And then, I dream, how you securely sleep,  
And in your dreams do laugh at me. I hate,  
And pray Love all may ; he pities my state,  
**But says, I therein no revenge shall find ;  
The sun would shine, though all the world were blind**.  
Yet, to try my hate, Love show'd me your tear ;  
And I had died, had not your smile been there.  
Your frown undoes me ; your smile is my wealth ;  
And as you please to look, I have my health.  
Methought, Love pitying me, when he saw this,  
Gave me your hands, the backs and palms to kiss.  
That cured me not, but to bear pain gave strength ;  
And what is lost in force, is took in length.  
I call'd on Love again, who fear'd you so,  
That his compassion still proved greater woe ;  
For, then I dream'd I was in bed with you,  
But durst not feel, for fear it should not be true.  
This merits not your anger, had it been ;  
The queen of chastity was naked seen ;  
And in bed not to feel, the pain I took,  
Was more than for Actæon not to look ;  
And that breast which lay ope, I did not know,  
But for the clearness, **from a lump of snow ;**  
Nor that sweet teat which on the top it bore  
From the **rose-bud** which for my sake you wore.  
These griefs to issue forth, by verse I prove ;  
Or turn their course by travel and new love.  
All would not do ; the best at last I tried ;  
Unable longer to hold out, I died.  
And then I found I lost life, death by flying ;  
Who hundreds live, are but so long in dying.  
Charon did let me pass ; I'll him requite.  
**To mark the groves or shades wrongs my delight ;**  
**I'll speak but of those ghosts I found alone,  
Those thousand ghosts, whereof myself made one**,  
All images of thee ; I asked them why ?  
The judge told me, all they for thee did die,  
And therefore had for their Elysian bliss,  
In one another their own loves to kiss.  
O here I miss'd not blissh, but being dead ;  
For lo ! I dreamt, I dreamt, and waking said,  
“ Heaven, if who are in thee there must dwell,  
How is't I now was there, and now I fell ?”

[by John Donne](https://m.poemhunter.com/john-donne/)

** **This is the intellectual mode of mysticism,  the mode where by the sentiment of unity, deployed and its elements dissociated in arbitrary symbols, is made to seem first the experience of unity, and then, by the coercive charm of form \(James phrase\) the emotion of unity. The point is that the mystical insight-self-extinguishing as it is held to beis not itself **a proper object of poetry or any rational art. It is ultimate matter for super-rational discipline. Hence poetry cannot give the insight; but it can give, can represent in the most nearly actual form of which imagination is capable, the elements and as it were the substance of the experience in which**

\[114\]

**that insight terminates. And this is the light, self-illuminating and self-restricting, in which to look at Mr. Maas poetry: looking to see what is there in that reality which, as it exists, every technical device must buttress and sustain, and from which other realities, if ever, must spring. There is, in this poet, a good deal, and as he enlarges his vocabulary **there will be more. The reality sought for is found only through the reality and richness of language on the \*\*representative level\*\*

ALLOPHANES.  
UNSEASONABLE man, statue of ice,  
What could to countries solitude entice  
Thee, in this year's cold and decrepit time ?  
Nature's instinct draws to the warmer clime  
Even smaller birds, who by that courage dare  
In numerous fleets sail through their sea, the air.  
What delicacy can in fields appear,  
Whilst Flora herself doth a frieze jerkin wear ?  
Whilst winds do all the trees and hedges strip  
Of leaves, to furnish rods enough to whip  
Thy madness from thee, and all springs by frost  
Have taken cold, and their sweet murmurs lost?  
If thou thy faults or fortunes wouldst lament  
With just solemnity, do it in Lent.  
At court the spring already advanced is,  
The sun stays longer up ; and yet not his  
The glory is ; far other, other fires.  
First, zeal to prince and state, then love's desires  
Burn in one breast, and like heaven's two great lights,  
The first doth govern days, the other, nights.  
And then that early light which did appear  
Before the sun and moon created were,  
The princes favour is diffused o'er all,  
From which all fortunes, names, and natures fall.  
Then from those wombs of stars, the bride's bright eyes,  
At every glance, a constellation flies,  
And sows the court with stars, and doth prevent  
In light and power, the all-eyed firmament.  
First her eyes kindle other ladies' eyes,  
Then from their beams their jewels' lustres rise,  
And from their jewels torches do take fire,  
And all is warmth, and light, and good desire.  
Most other courts, alas ! are like to hell,  
Where in dark places, fire without light doth dwell ;  
Or but like stoves ; for lust and envy get  
Continual, but artificial heat.  
Here zeal and love grown one all clouds digest,  
And make our court an everlasting east.  
And canst thou be from thence ?  
  
IDIOS. No, I am there ;  
As heaven—to men disposed—is everywhere,  
So are those courts, whose princes animate  
Not only all their house but all their state.  
Let no man think, because he's full, he hath all.  
Kings—as their pattern, God—are liberal  
Not only in fullness, but capacity,  
Enlarging narrow men to feel and see,  
And comprehend the blessings they bestow.  
So, reclused hermits oftentimes do know  
More of heaven's glory than a worldling can.  
As man is of the world, the heart of man  
Is an epitome of God's great book  
Of creatures, and man need no farther look ;  
So is the country of courts, where sweet peace doth,  
As their one common soul, give life to both ;  
And am I then from court ?  
  
ALLOPHANES. Dreamer, thou art :  
Think'st thou, fantastic, that thou hast a part  
In the Indian fleet, because thou hast  
A little spice or amber in thy taste ?  
Because thou art not frozen, art thou warm ?  
Seest thou all good, because thou seest no harm ?  
The earth doth in her inner bowels hold  
Stuff well-disposed, and which would fain be gold ;  
But never shall, except it chance to lie  
So upward, that heaven gild it with his eye.  
As, for divine things, faith comes from above,  
So, for best civil use, all tinctures move  
From higher powers ; from God religion springs,  
Wisdom and honour from the use of kings :  
Then unbeguile thyself, and know with me,  
That angels, though on earth employ'd they be,  
Are still in heaven, so is he still at home  
That doth abroad to honest actions come.  
Chide thyself then, O fool, which yesterday  
Mightst have read more than all thy books bewray ;  
Hast thou a history, which doth present  
A court, where all affections do assent  
Unto the king's, and that that king's are just ;  
And where it is no levity to trust ;  
Where there is no ambition, but to obey ;  
Where men need whisper nothing, and yet may ;  
Where the king's favours are so placed, that all  
Find that the king therein is liberal  
To them, in him, because his favours bend  
To virtue, to the which they all pretend ?  
Thou hast no such ; yet here was this, and more.  
An earnest lover, wise then, and before,  
Our little Cupid hath sued livery,  
And is no more in his minority ;  
He is admitted now into that breast  
Where the king's counsels and his secrets rest.  
What hast thou lost, O ignorant man ?  
  
IDIOS. I knew  
All this, and only therefore I withdrew.  
To know and feel all this, and not to have  
Words to express it, makes a man a grave  
Of his own thoughts ; I would not therefore stay  
At a great feast, having no grace to say.  
And yet I 'scaped not here ; for being come  
Full of the common joy, I utter'd some.  
Read then this nuptial song, which was not made  
Either the court or men's hearts to invade ;  
But since I am dead and buried, I could frame  
No epitaph, which might advance my fame  
So much as this poor song, which testifies  
I did unto that day some sacrifice.  
  
  
I.  
  
THE TIME OF THE MARRIAGE.  
  
Thou art reprieved, old year, thou shalt not die ;  
Though thou upon thy death-bed lie,  
And should'st within five days expire,  
Yet thou art rescued by a mightier fire,  
Than thy old soul, the sun,  
When he doth in his largest circle run.  
The passage of the west or east would thaw,  
And open wide their easy liquid jaw  
To all our ships, could a Promethean art  
Either unto the northern pole impart  
The fire of these inflaming eyes, or of this loving  
heart.  
  
  
II.  
  
EQUALITY OF PERSONS.  
  
But undiscerning Muse, which heart, which eyes,  
In this new couple, dost thou prize,  
When his eye as inflaming is  
As hers, and her heart loves as well as his ?  
Be tried by beauty, and then  
The bridegroom is a maid, and not a man ;  
If by that manly courage they be tried,  
Which scorns unjust opinion ; then the bride  
Becomes a man. Should chance or envy's art  
Divide these two, whom nature scarce did part,  
Since both have the inflaming eye, and both the  
loving heart?  
  
  
III.  
  
RAISING OF THE BRIDEGROOM.  
  
Though it be some divorce to think of you  
Single, so much one are you two,  
Let me here contemplate thee,  
First, cheerful bridegroom, and first let me see,  
How thou prevent'st the sun,  
And his red foaming horses dost outrun ;  
How, having laid down in thy Sovereign's breast  
All businesses, from thence to reinvest  
Them when these triumphs cease, thou forward art  
To show to her, who doth the like impart,  
The fire of thy inflaming eyes, and of thy loving heart.  
  
  
IV.  
  
RAISING OF THE BRIDE.  
  
But now to thee, fair bride, it is some wrong,  
To think thou wert in bed so long.  
Since soon thou liest down first, 'tis fit  
Thou in first rising shouldst allow for it.  
Powder thy radiant hair,  
Which if without such ashes thou wouldst wear,  
Thou which, to all which come to look upon,  
Wert meant for Phoebus, wouldst be Phaëton.  
For our ease, give thine eyes th' unusual part  
Of joy, a tear ; so quench'd, thou mayst impart,  
To us that come, thy inflaming eyes ; to him, thy  
loving heart.  
  
  
V.  
  
HER APPARELLING.  
  
Thus thou descend'st to our infirmity,  
Who can the sun in water see.  
So dost thou, when in silk and gold  
Thou cloud'st thyself ; since we which do behold  
Are dust and worms, 'tis just,  
Our objects be the fruits of worms and dust.  
Let every jewel be a glorious star,  
Yet stars are not so pure as their spheres are ;  
And though thou stoop, to appear to us, in part,  
Still in that picture thou entirely art,  
Which thy inflaming eyes have made within his  
loving heart.  
  
  
VI.  
  
GOING TO THE CHAPEL.  
  
Now from your easts you issue forth, and we,  
As men, which through a cypress see  
The rising sun, do think it two ;  
So, as you go to church, do think of you ;  
But that veil being gone,  
By the church rites you are from thenceforth one.  
The church triumphant made this match before,  
And now the militant doth strive no more.  
Then, reverend priest, who God's Recorder art,  
Do, from his dictates, to these two impart  
All blessings which are seen, or thought, by angel's  
eye or heart.  
  
  
VII.  
  
THE BENEDICTION.  
  
Blest pair of swans, O may you interbring  
Daily new joys, and never sing ;  
Live, till all grounds of wishes fail,  
Till honour, yea, till wisdom grow so stale,  
That new great heights to try,  
I must serve your ambition, to die ;  
Raise heirs, and may here, to the world's end, live  
Heirs from this king, to take thanks, you, to give.  
Nature and grace do all, and nothing art ;  
May never age or error overthwart  
With any west these radiant eyes, with any north  
this heart.  
  
  
VIII.  
  
FEASTS AND REVELS.  
  
But you are over-blest. Plenty this day  
Injures ; it causeth time to stay ;  
The tables groan, as though this feast  
Would, as the flood, destroy all fowl and beast.  
And were the doctrine new  
That the earth moved, this day would make it true ;  
For every part to dance and revel goes,  
They tread the air, and fall not where they rose.  
Though six hours since the sun to bed did part,  
The masks and banquets will not yet impart  
A sunset to these weary eyes, a centre to this heart.  
  
  
IX.  
  
THE BRIDE'S GOING TO BED.  
  
What mean'st thou, bride, this company to keep ?  
To sit up, till thou fain wouldst sleep ?  
Thou mayst not, when thou'rt laid, do so ;  
Thyself must to him a new banquet grow ;  
And you must entertain  
And do all this day's dances o'er again.  
Know that if sun and moon together do  
Rise in one point, they do not set so too.  
Therefore thou mayst, fair bride, to bed depart ;  
Thou art not gone, being gone ; where'er thou art,  
Thou leavest in him thy watchful eyes, in him thy  
loving heart.  
  
  
X.  
  
THE BRIDEGROOM'S COMING.  
  
As he that sees a star fall, runs apace,  
And finds a jelly in the place,  
So doth the bridegroom haste as much,  
Being told this star is fallen, and finds her such.  
And as friends may look strange,  
By a new fashion, or apparel's change,  
Their souls, though long acquainted they had been,  
These clothes, their bodies, never yet had seen.  
Therefore at first she modestly might start,  
But must forthwith surrender every part,  
As freely as each to each before gave either eye or  
heart.  
  
  
XI.  
  
THE GOOD-NIGHT.  
  
Now, as in Tullia's tomb, one lamp burnt clear,  
Unchanged for fifteen hundred year,  
May these love-lamps we here enshrine,  
In warmth, light, lasting, equal the divine.  
Fire ever doth aspire,  
And makes all like itself, turns all to fire,  
But ends in ashes ; which these cannot do,  
For none of these is fuel, but fire too.  
This is joy's bonfire, then, where love's strong arts  
Make of so noble individual parts  
One fire of four inflaming eyes, and of two loving hearts.  
  
IDIOS. As I have brought this song, that I may do  
A perfect sacrifice, I'll burn it too.  
  
ALLOPHANES. No, sir. This paper I have justly got,  
For, in burnt incense, the perfume is not  
His only that presents it, but of all ;  
Whatever celebrates this festival  
Is common, since the joy thereof is so.  
Nor may yourself be priest ; but let me go  
Back to the court, and I will lay it upon  
Such altars, as prize your devotion.
