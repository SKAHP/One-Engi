### A TELEPLAY/SCREENPLAY

FOR PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTION

```markdown
>At the outset, may we explain that there is virtually no difference in
typing format between the teleplay and the feature or theatrical screen-
play. The reason for this is that the vast majority of television dramas
are, now produced on motion picture film. Conversely, many feature-
length motion pictures are now made especially for television. And so,
the boundaries between the two media have all but disappeared. To be
sure, some teleplays are produced on tape rather than film, and a
special page on the live-tape format is included in this booklet. May
you win the Oscar and the Emmy! But first, a few basic points.
