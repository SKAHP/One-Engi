Let mans Soule be a Spheare, and then, in this,  
The intelligence that moves, devotion is  
And as the other Spheares, by being growne  
Subject to forraigne motions, lose their owne  
And being by others hurried every day,  
Scarce in a yeare their natural! forme obey:  
Pleasure or businesse, so, our Soules admit  
For their first mover, and are whirld by it.  
Hence is's, that I am carryed towards the West  
This day, when my Soules forme bends toward the East.  
There I should see a Sunne, by rising set,  
And by that setting endlesse day beget;  
But that Christ on this Crosse, did rise and fall,  
Sinne had eternally benighted all.  
Yet dare \['almost be glad, I do not see  
That spectacle of too much weight for meet  
Who sees Gods face, that is selfe life, must dye;  
What a death were it then to see God dye?  
It made his owne Lieutenant Nature shrinke,  
It made his footstoole crack, and the Sunne winke.  
Could I behold those hands which span the Poles,  
And tune all spheares at once, peirc'd with those holes?  
Could I behold that endlesse height which is  
Zenith to us, and to'our Antipodes,  
Humbled below us? or that blood which is  
The seat of all our Soules, if not of his,  
Make curt of dust, or that flesh which was worne  
By God, for his apparel!, rag'd, and tome?  
If on these things I durst not looke, durst I  
Upon his miserable mother cast mine eye,  
Who was Gods partner here, and furnish'd thus  
Halfe of that Sacrifice, which ransom'd us?  
Though these things, as I ride, be from mine eye,  
They'are present yet unto my memory,  
For that looks towards them; and thou look'st towards mee,  
O Saviour, as thou hang'st upon the tree;  
I turne my backe to thee, but to receive  
Corrections, till thy mercies bid thee leave.  
O thinke mee worth shine anger, punish mee,  
Burne off my rusts, and my deformity,  
Restore shine Image, so much, by thy grace,  
That thou may'st know mee, and I'll turne my face.

\#\# Seek True Religion!

\*\*Donne, John \(1573-1631\)\*\*

```
                         Though Truth and Falsehood be
```

Near twins, yet Truth a little elder is.

Be busy to seek her; believe me this:

He's not of none, nor worst, that seeks the best.

To adore, or scorn an image, or protest,

May all be bad. Doubt wisely; in strange way

To stand inquiring right is not to stray;

To sleep or run wrong is.  On a huge hill,

Cragg¬èd and steep, Truth stands, and he that will

Reach her, about must and about must go,

And what the hill's suddenness resists, win so.

Yet strive so, that before age, death's twilight,

Thy soul rest, for none can work in that night.

To will implies delay; therefore now do.

Hard deeds that body's pains; hard knowledge too,

The mind's eneavours reach; and mysteries

Are like the sun, dazzling, yet plain to all eyes.

Keep the truth which thou hast found; men do not stand

In so ill case here that God hath with his hand

Signed kings blank charters to kill whom they hate,

Nor are they vicars, but hangmen to Fate.

Fool and wretch, wilt thou let thy soul be tied

To man's laws, by which she shall not be tried

At the last day? Will it then boot thee

To say a Philip or a Gregory,

A Harry, or a Martin taught thee this?

Is not this excuse for mere contraries

Equally strong?  Cannot both sides say so?

That thou mayst rightly obey Power, her bounds know;

Those passed, her nature and name's changed; to be

Then humble to her is idolatry.

As streams are Power is; those blest flowers that dwell

At the rough stream's calm head thrive and prove well,

But having left their roots and themselves given

To the stream's tyrannous rage, alas, are driven

Through mills and rocks and woods, and at last almost

```
Consumed in going, in the sea are lost.
```

So perish souls which more choose men's unjust

# A Nocturnal Upon St. Lucy's Day,

# Being The Shortest Day

'Tis the year's midnight, and it is the day's,  
Lucy's, who scarce seven hours herself unmasks;  
The sun is spent, and now his flasks  
Send forth light squibs, no constant rays;  
The world's whole sap is sunk;  
The general balm th' hydroptic earth hath drunk,  
Whither, as to the bed's feet, life is shrunk,  
Dead and interr'd; yet all these seem to laugh,  
Compar'd with me, who am their epitaph.

Study me then, you who shall lovers be  
At the next world, that is, at the next spring;  
For I am every dead thing,  
In whom Love wrought new alchemy.  
For his art did express  
A quintessence even from nothingness,  
From dull privations, and lean emptiness;  
He ruin'd me, and I am re-begot  
Of absence, darkness, death: things which are not.

All others, from all things, draw all that's good,  
Life, soul, form, spirit, whence they being have;  
I, by Love's limbec, am the grave  
Of all that's nothing. Oft a flood  
Have we two wept, and so  
Drown'd the whole world, us two; oft did we grow  
To be two chaoses, when we did show  
Care to aught else; and often absences  
Withdrew our souls, and made us carcasses.

But I am by her death \(which word wrongs her\)  
Of the first nothing the elixir grown;  
Were I a man, that I were one  
I needs must know; I should prefer,  
If I were any beast,  
Some ends, some means; yea plants, yea stones detest,  
And love; all, all some properties invest;  
If I an ordinary nothing were,  
As shadow, a light and body must be here.

But I am none; nor will my sun renew.  
You lovers, for whose sake the lesser sun  
At this time to the Goat is run  
To fetch new lust, and give it you,  
Enjoy your summer all;  
Since she enjoys her long night's festival,  
Let me prepare towards her, and let me call  
This hour her vigil, and her eve, since this  
Both the year's, and the day's deep midnight is.

# TWICKENHAM GARDEN.

BLASTED with sighs, and surrounded with tears,

Hither I come to seek the spring,

And at mine eyes, and at mine ears,

Receive such balms as else cure every thing.

But O ! self-traitor, I do bring

The spider Love, which transubstantiates all,

And can convert manna to gall ;

And that this place may thoroughly be thought

True paradise, I have the serpent brought.

'Twere wholesomer for me that winter did

Benight the glory of this place,

And that a grave frost did forbid

These trees to laugh and mock me to my face ;

But that I may not this disgrace

Endure, nor yet leave loving, Love, let me

Some senseless piece of this place be ;

Make me a mandrake, so I may grow here,

Or a stone fountain weeping out my year.

Hither with crystal phials, lovers, come,

And take my tears, which are love's wine,

And try your mistress' tears at home,

For all are false, that taste not just like mine.

Alas ! hearts do not in eyes shine,

Nor can you more judge women's thoughts by tears,

Than by her shadow what she wears.

O perverse sex, where none is true but she,

Who's therefore true, because her truth kills me

# **A Lecture upon the Shadow**

**BY**

[**JOHN DONNE**](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne)

**Stand still, and I will read to thee**

**A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.**

**These three hours that we have spent,**

**Walking here, two shadows went**

**Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.**

**But, now the sun is just above our head,**

**We do those shadows tread,**

** And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.**

**So whilst our infant loves did grow,**

**Disguises did, and shadows, flow**

**From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.**

**That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,**

**Which is still diligent lest others see.**

**Except our loves at this noon stay,**

**We shall new shadows make the other way.**

**As the first were made to blind**

**Others, these which come behind**

**Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.**

**If our loves faint, and westwardly decline**

**To me thou, falsely, thine, **

**And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.**

**The morning shadows wear away,**

**But these grow longer all the day;**

**But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.**

**Love is a growing, or full constant light,**

**And his first minute, after noon, is night.**
