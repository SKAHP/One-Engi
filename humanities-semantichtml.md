# A Nocturnal Upon St. Lucy's Day,

# Being The Shortest Day

'Tis the year's midnight, and it is the day's,  
Lucy's, who scarce seven hours herself unmasks;  
The sun is spent, and now his flasks  
Send forth light squibs, no constant rays;  
The world's whole sap is sunk;  
The general balm th' hydroptic earth hath drunk,  
Whither, as to the bed's feet, life is shrunk,  
Dead and interr'd; yet all these seem to laugh,  
Compar'd with me, who am their epitaph.

Study me then, you who shall lovers be  
At the next world, that is, at the next spring;  
For I am every dead thing,  
In whom Love wrought new alchemy.  
For his art did express  
A quintessence even from nothingness,  
From dull privations, and lean emptiness;  
He ruin'd me, and I am re-begot  
Of absence, darkness, death: things which are not.

All others, from all things, draw all that's good,  
Life, soul, form, spirit, whence they being have;  
I, by Love's limbec, am the grave  
Of all that's nothing. Oft a flood  
Have we two wept, and so  
Drown'd the whole world, us two; oft did we grow  
To be two chaoses, when we did show  
Care to aught else; and often absences  
Withdrew our souls, and made us carcasses.

But I am by her death \(which word wrongs her\)  
Of the first nothing the elixir grown;  
Were I a man, that I were one  
I needs must know; I should prefer,  
If I were any beast,  
Some ends, some means; yea plants, yea stones detest,  
And love; all, all some properties invest;  
If I an ordinary nothing were,  
As shadow, a light and body must be here.

But I am none; nor will my sun renew.  
You lovers, for whose sake the lesser sun  
At this time to the Goat is run  
To fetch new lust, and give it you,  
Enjoy your summer all;  
Since she enjoys her long night's festival,  
Let me prepare towards her, and let me call  
This hour her vigil, and her eve, since this  
Both the year's, and the day's deep midnight is.

# TWICKENHAM GARDEN.

BLASTED with sighs, and surrounded with tears,

Hither I come to seek the spring,

And at mine eyes, and at mine ears,

Receive such balms as else cure every thing.

But O ! self-traitor, I do bring

The spider Love, which transubstantiates all,

And can convert manna to gall ;

And that this place may thoroughly be thought

True paradise, I have the serpent brought.

'Twere wholesomer for me that winter did

Benight the glory of this place,

And that a grave frost did forbid

These trees to laugh and mock me to my face ;

But that I may not this disgrace

Endure, nor yet leave loving, Love, let me

Some senseless piece of this place be ;

Make me a mandrake, so I may grow here,

Or a stone fountain weeping out my year.

Hither with crystal phials, lovers, come,

And take my tears, which are love's wine,

And try your mistress' tears at home,

For all are false, that taste not just like mine.

Alas ! hearts do not in eyes shine,

Nor can you more judge women's thoughts by tears,

Than by her shadow what she wears.

O perverse sex, where none is true but she,

Who's therefore true, because her truth kills me

# **A Lecture upon the Shadow**

**BY**

[**JOHN DONNE**](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne)

**Stand still, and I will read to thee**

**A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.**

**These three hours that we have spent,**

**Walking here, two shadows went**

**Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.**

**But, now the sun is just above our head,**

**We do those shadows tread,**

** And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.**

**So whilst our infant loves did grow,**

**Disguises did, and shadows, flow**

**From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.**

**That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,**

**Which is still diligent lest others see.**

**Except our loves at this noon stay,**

**We shall new shadows make the other way.**

**As the first were made to blind**

**Others, these which come behind**

**Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.**

**If our loves faint, and westwardly decline**

**To me thou, falsely, thine, **

**And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.**

**The morning shadows wear away,**

**But these grow longer all the day;**

**But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.**

**Love is a growing, or full constant light,**

**And his first minute, after noon, is night.**
