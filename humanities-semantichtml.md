# **A Lecture upon the Shadow**

**BY**

[**JOHN DONNE**](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne)

**Stand still, and I will read to thee**

**A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.**

**These three hours that we have spent,**

**Walking here, two shadows went**

**Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.**

**But, now the sun is just above our head,**

**We do those shadows tread,**

** And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.**

**So whilst our infant loves did grow,**

**Disguises did, and shadows, flow**

**From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.**

**That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,**

**Which is still diligent lest others see.**

**Except our loves at this noon stay,**

**We shall new shadows make the other way.**

**As the first were made to blind**

**Others, these which come behind**

**Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.**

**If our loves faint, and westwardly decline**

**To me thou, falsely, thine, **

**And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.**

**The morning shadows wear away,**

**But these grow longer all the day;**

**But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.**

**Love is a growing, or full constant light,**

**And his first minute, after noon, is night.**





AUTUMN SONG

Once I thought earth held all answer,

Held all strength men need live by,

Thought to live by sight of ash trees

Burning copper in the sky;

Thought the marshwort sign and symbol

Of a great sustaining law-

He who ploughed a field of marshwort

Blind and fit for beetle's claw.

Flower of fungus-graph of wisdom

Angels in a trumpet-pod,

Lichen outweighed love and lover--

Hieroglyphs of God

What are these things,

Now vour silence

\*\*Bricks a wall before my eyes?

What are spikenard, spurge and arum?

What is marshwort now?

Sprigs of grass and shadow spattered

Fit for rake and share and harrow.

Gone is meaning, nothing matters-

Let the blindman plough!
