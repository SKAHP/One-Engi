# Annunciation

### Salvation to all that will is nigh;  
That All, which always is all everywhere, 
Which cannot sin, and yet all sins must bear,  
Which cannot die, yet cannot choose but die,  
Lo, faithful virgin, yields Himself to lie  
In prison, in thy womb; and though He there  
Can take no sin, nor thou give, yet He will wear,  
Taken from thence, flesh, which death's force may try.  
Ere by the spheres time was created, thou  
Wast in His mind, who is thy Son and Brother;  
Whom thou conceivst, conceived; yea thou art now  
Thy Maker's maker, and thy Father's mother;  
### Thou hast light in dark, and shutst in little room,  
### Immensity cloistered in thy dear womb.
