Immanuel Kant is often regarded as an exponent of the ‘individualist’ tradition in epistemology, according to which testimony is not a fundamental

source of knowledge.

The​ ​present​ ​paper​ ​argues​ ​that​ ​this​ ​view​ ​is​ ​far​ ​from​ ​accurate.

Kant​ ​devotes​ ​ample​ ​space  
 to​ ​discussions​ ​of​ ​testimony​ ​and,​ ​in​ ​his​ ​lectures​ ​on​ ​logic,

arrives at a distinct and stable  
 philosophical position regarding testimony.​ ​Important​ ​elements

of​ ​this​ ​position​ ​consist  
 in​.

a\) acknowledging the ineliminability of testimony;

b\) realising that testimony can

establish empirical knowledge with certainty;

c\) establishing a presumptive principle

regarding the acceptance of testimony;

d\) arguing for a symmetry between knowledge

based on experience and knowledge based on testimony. Rejecting

testimony as a

fundamental source of knowledge merely on the basis that no

theoretically necessary

ground for its truth can be given, would, as Kant puts it, indicate ‘a

lack of moral

interest’. Such ‘incredulity’ would be a form of ‘logical egoism’: It

demonstrates an

unwillingness or inability to think oneself in the place of others, yet this

we must do if

we are to trust our own judgments. While Kant strongly endorses

testimony as a source

of empirical knowledge, he does, however, make one important

restriction:

‘Propositions of reason’ \(Vernunftwahrheiten\), such as universal moral

principles, may

not be adopted on the basis of testimony. I argue that this distinction,

between

testimonial knowledge of empirical matters of fact and individual

knowledge of

propositions of reason, is an important element of Kant’s epistemology

of testimony, as

it explains how his strong endorsement of testimony as a source of

knowledge can be

squared with his equally strong demand for intellectual autonomy.

Finally, I comment

on the overall implications of this account for Kant’s discussion,

elsewhere in his work,

of the public nature of communication.
