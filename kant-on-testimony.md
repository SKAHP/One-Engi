Introduction

Immanuel Kant may seem an unlikely candidate to recruit for the cause of social

epistemology, and for the epistemology of testimony in particular. It seems fair to say

that, second perhaps only to Descartes, Kant has come to be seen as the prototypical example

of a philosopher in the ‘individualist’ tradition – that is, a tradition according to which ‘testimony

has little or no epistemic importance’

Thus, Anthony Coady, in his seminal and influential monograph Testimony: A philosophical

study \(1992\), makes no substantive reference to Kant, and even those contemporary

philosophers with a more explicit agenda of social epistemology frequently cast Kant

in the exemplary role of individualist philosopher as far as testimony is concerned.

3 Frederick Schmitt, for example, writes that ‘the way sociality enters’ into Kant’s

philosophy is such that ‘sideb is no reliance on testimony’ \(Schmitt 1987: 47\).

In the present paper, I argue that such views do not adequately reflect Kant’s position

regarding testimony. What is overlooked is that Kant does, in fact, have a well-developed

epistemology of testimony, which features most prominently in his. lectures on logic and which

gains further support from remarks he makes about testimony in his other writings. Beyond

acknowledging the ineliminability of testimony and the fact that testimony can, and frequently

does, produce knowledge, Kant argues for a continuity between testimony and experience.

Regarding its epistemic characteristics, testimonial knowledge is, Kant argues, ‘neither in

degree nor in kind in any way to be distinguished’ from knowledge based on one’s own

experience.4 This symmetry thesis, together with the additional argument that ‘incredulity’

regarding testimony shows ‘lack of moral interest’ establishes a presumptive principle regarding

the acceptance of testimony: Testimony is to be believed, unless we know that certain defeating

conditions obtain.

The mere possibility of failure of testimony, whether due to lying or mere error, does not suffice

to undermine the presumption. One important restriction does, however, apply:

‘Propositions of reason’ \(Vernunftwahrheiten\), such as moral truths, though communicable

formaliter, may not be adopted on the basis of testimony. As I shall. argue in the final section,

this points to a way of squaring Kant’s sympathy towards testimony with the strong demand for

autonomy expressed in the maxim ‘to think for oneself’. First, however, it seems appropriate to

say a little more about where in Kant’s work his epistemology of testimony is locate. Locating

Kant’s epistemology of testimony Unlike, for example, Hume, whose influential text

‘On Miracles’

6 is the standard

historical point for many contemporary papers in the epistemology of

testimony, Kant never published a fully developed, self-contained text on the subject. His

position must therefore be inferred from a variety of passages and comments scattered

throughout his work. By far the most detailed and explicit treatment of testimony in Kant’s work

is to be found in his lectures on logic. These lectures, over a period of forty years \(1755-1795\),

formed part of the core of Kant’s teaching duties at Königsberg.

7 Throughout, the lectures were based on Georg Friedrich Meier’s Vernunftlehre \(1752\), and in

particular on a shorter extract, the Auszug aus der Vernunftlehre, which was published the

same year. From the testimony of his students

8, it is known that Kant lectured directly from his heavily annotated copy of

the Auszug. Kant’s notes, together with the text of Meier’s Auszug, have been made

available as Volume XVI of the Academy edition, and these Reflexionen will function

as an important source of information in the following pages. Fortunately, there are

also a number of lecture notes by Kant’s students, of which several sets have been

edited and analysed in the last few decades and which span a period of several decades.

9 Finally, there is the work of Gottlob Benjamin Jäsche, whom Kant commissioned to write up

his logic as a ‘manual for lectures’. Though published in

1800, before Kant’s death, and listed, in the Academy edition, amongst Kant’s own

works, the accuracy of the Jäsche Logic is hotly contested.10 Given that more direct

accounts of Kant’s logic lectures have recently become available11, it will therefore not be relied

upon in the present paper. Despite the heavy reliance on Meier’s logic, Kant’s aim was never

purely

didactical or exegetical.

On the contrary: In an announcement for the winter semester

1765/66, Kant explains he has chosen Meier’s text because its diversity ‘gives

occasion, during the critique of reason, to also look at the critique of taste’ and to

reflect on ‘the practical and healthy understanding’.

12 Elsewhere, Kant confirms that

in his lectures, he ‘aimed at not merely commenting on the author \[...\] but at

assessing, weighing and expanding \[his argument\], and at bringing it together under principles

that to me seemed better.

’13 Also, Kant did not shy away from modifying the material he presented or correcting the

author where he saw it fit. For example,

when Meier writes that ‘faith \(fides historica\) is the approval \[Beifall\] which we give a thing on

the basis of \[someone’s\] testimony’, Kant sees this as a flaw and, according to the Vienna

Logic, argues:

Our author \[=Meier\] relates belief \[=fides\] merely to testimony

.14 We distinguish, however, between believing something and believing someone. We can

believe something without someone’s having said it to us. We can believe someone if we have

accepted something on his testimony. Proofs from experience may well show that the thing is,

but not the absolute necessity of the thing.

For experience gives only something contingent.

1. In recent years, a much clearer picture of the development of Kant’s thought has

emerged and it is now widely acknowledged that there is no clear demarcation between Kant

‘the teacher’ and Kant ‘the writer-philosopher’, and that any account of Kant’s philosophical

development will profit from a fine-grained analysis that goes

beyond the traditional differentiation between a critical and pre-critical phase.16 This

is true in particular of Kant’s lectures on logic which, it has been argued, anticipate a

number of moves and strategies that later feature prominently in the Critiques.17 As

Giorgio Tonelli argues, quite generally, ‘logic was never dissociated from the

methodological consideration of the substance of thought, i.e. from subjects which we

assign today to the “Theory of Knowledge”’ \(Tonelli 1975: 187\). It is the aim of the

present paper to argue that the same could be said, more specifically, about the

epistemology of testimony. By drawing on the body of Kant’s logical work, as well as

his Reflexionen and other writings, I hope to show that testimony, too, has a

substantive place in his philosophy and cannot be divorced from his thinking about

knowledge, autonomy and communication.

Taking testimony seriously

The fundamental worry about testimony, which Kant, as the quote in the previous

section suggests, was well aware of, concerns the fact that the relation between

testimony and truth is at best contingent. The mere act of testifying bears no

necessary relation to the truth of the matter in question. On Kant’s account this is

true a fortiori, since experience quite generally ‘gives only something contingent’;

hence, the same must be true of testimony, which, after all, purports to communicate

knowledge based on others’ experiences. Beyond the general fallibility of all empirical

knowledge, however, there are special problems regarding testimony as a source of

knowledge, mainly due to the fact that testimony crucially involves other epistemic

agents. This leads to two distinct possibilities of how testimony can systematically fail

to generate knowledge: namely, when the speaker is incompetent or insincere. It will

therefore be of interest to see what Kant has to say about competence and sincerity as

prerequisites for a good witness.

Kant raises the topic of competence only in very general terms and mainly

follows Meier’s discussion of ‘Tüchtigkeit’ \(dexteritas\), who defined a competent

witness as someone who possesses ‘sufficient powers to not only acquire the right

experience but also to designate it in the right way’ \(Auszug, § 207\).18 In particular,

there is no further attempt to define competence in terms of reliability, for example

along probabilistic lines. Kant is notoriously sceptical about the prospects of a logic of

probability \(see Cataldi Madonna 1992: 35\); where we cannot have certainty – as in

cases of testimony where the competence of the witness may be in doubt – we can

only judge on a case by case basis. Those scholars in the Leibniz-Wolff tradition, who

extrapolate from the mathematics of probability to a logica probabilium, hoping that

the latter can solve epistemological puzzles, in Kant’s opinion are misguided.19 In his

Anthropology From a Pragmatic Point of View \(1798\), Kant says as much when he

writes about sagacity \(‘a natural talent to judge tentatively, as to where the truth may

well be found’\): ‘The logic of the schools teaches us nothing about this.’ 20

Competence eludes formal definition because it is essentially a skill that varies with

context: ‘It is not in all cases so easy to acquire experiences, and it takes practice.’21

Interestingly, competence on this account is not conceived of as entirely within the

witness but also takes into account the circumstances under which experiences are

made. In order for someone to be a competent witness, what is required is not only

ability but also opportunity.22

In addition to observational skills and favourable circumstances, a third

element is required for a competent witness, namely ‘the adroitness to declare his

experiences so that one can well understand what he means’. This, Kant recognises,

‘is not so easy’. Some people report their experiences with a high degree of accuracy

\(pünktlich\), others are able to sketch ‘but a light silhouette of their experience, and

are unable to give an account of all the circumstances’.23 A general inability to express

oneself clearly and accurately, in this context, is far more detrimental than an

occasional lapse \(such as a wrong empirical judgment, or the use of a wrong term\), as

it introduces a systematic error. As Kant already noted, in a somewhat aphoristic

manner, in his Reflexionen: ‘Error in principles is greater than in their application,

\[...\] violation of grammar worse than vocabularies \(worst in logic\).’24 In the light of

Kant’s emphasis, throughout his philosophy, on the importance of \(law-like\) rules

that should structure, and govern, thought and action, it seems plausible to argue

that these examples indicate that, in the case of competence, too, it is systematic

failures – due to a lack of rule-guidedness – rather than accidental failures that are of

philosophical significance. Whereas accidental failures merely indicate the fallibility

of experience in general, systematic failures pose a more general threat to knowledge

acquisition. Mental illness, for example, casts doubt on the competence of a person

\(AA, VII, 202-220\), but not so much because it necessarily generates false beliefs as

because it shows a lack of rule-guidedness on the part of the speaker. Thus,

competence, when analysed in terms of Tüchtigkeit, is not a statistical point about

someone’s being right more often than wrong, but requires the presence of an

adequate ‘rule-guidedness’ of reasoning and observation. As mentioned earlier,

according to Kant spelling out what these rules are does not fall within the remit of

logic. However, this does not preclude the possibility of further characterisation by

other means, and one such attempt will be discussed in a later section.

Kant, as is evident from this discussion, does not attempt to justify testimony by

accumulating empirical evidence of its reliability. In this, as well as in his rejection of

probabilistic concepts in assessing testimony, he differs from other philosophers,

such as David Hume, who also acknowledged the metaphysically tenuous link

between testimony and reality. It is therefore to be expected that Kant’s defence of

testimony as a source of knowledge, too, will take a rather different form. As a first

and important step, Kant proposes what one might call a symmetry thesis. This is

best expressed in the Vienna Logic:

\[W\]e can just as well accept something on the testimony of others as on our own experience.

For

there is just as much that is deceptive in our experience as in the testimony of others. Our

thinking,

when we hold an experience to be true, is subject to many hazards. To be sure, the testimony

that

we accept from others is subject to just as many hazards as our own experience is subject to

errors.

But we can just as well have certainty through the testimony of others as through our own

experience.25

Thus, acknowledging that testimony is subject to risk does not suffice to undermine

its status as a source of knowledge. It is possible to acquire knowledge from

testimony \(at least as far as factual matters are concerned\), and this calls for a robust

analysis in terms of knowledge rather than in terms of some substitute notion, such

as conjectural belief: ‘Where knowledge is possible, is itself already a matter of

knowledge’26, and determining the scope of testimonial knowledge is, as we shall see,

a challenge Kant does not shy away from.

An obligation to trust?

Merely pointing out that testimonial knowledge is possible, however, clearly does not

yet determine the extent to which we are to place trust in other people’s testimony.

Thus, in addition to the symmetry thesis, a second \(and, as we shall see shortly,

distinctly ‘Kantian’\) argument is required. It consists in establishing a presumptive

principle regarding the acceptance of testimony. Present-day discussions tend to

assimilate the problem of testimonial knowledge to the problem of epistemic

justification, thereby emphasising the recipient’s perspective and what one might call

his ‘presumptive right’ to accept testimony as true \(provided certain enabling

conditions hold, such as the absence of possible defeaters\).27 By contrast, Kant’s

presumptive principle does not so much establish a ‘presumptive right’ as a

‘presumptive obligation’ to accept another’s testimony. In a telling comment on the

very definition of what is testimony and what makes someone a testifier28, Kant

remarks:

One must never believe mischief in someone else, rather, if one is to act upon it, one must know

it

\[with certainty\]. The good, even if one has only a logical ground to opine it, one must believe.29

Not only is it logically possible that testimony should convey knowledge, we also have

a presumptive obligation not to distrust others. The mere fact that this is not a perfect

obligation – that is, universally owed to everyone irrespective of context – does not

render it any less fundamental. It does, however, call for a specification of the social

and institutional conditions which circumscribe its applicability.30 As we shall see

shortly, Kant is well aware of this requirement.

Testimonial belief requires an element of faith \(fides historica\), that is, an

exercise of trust. As Kant characterises it, ‘Fides is essentially faithfulness in an

agreement \[‘in pacto’\] or towards one another’.31 Hence, in accepting someone’s

testimony we do not just adopt a new belief, we trust him for the truth. Indeed, in the

Blomberg Logic, Kant draws an explicit parallel between trust in non-epistemic

matters and trusting someone’s testimony:

Fidelity is always required in regard to him who promises something, so that he keeps to what

was

promised\[;\] belief, however, is required in regard to him to whom something is promised,

namely,

so that he accepts as true that the other will keep his promise. The two must be combined with

each

other. \[…\] It also indicates a very bad mode of thought if one never trusts anyone in anything,

but

instead one wants to see everything that is promised and pledged to him present and fulfilled.32

It is this dual structure of a duty to fidelity combined with a duty not to be wantonly

suspicious which underlies Kant’s presumptive principle regarding the acceptance of

testimony. While Kant’s categorical stance on lying is well-known \(for example in his

essay On a Supposed Right to Lie From Philanthropy, where he describes lying as ‘a

wrong inflicted upon humanity’33\), what is frequently overlooked is the fact that he

issues an equally strong condemnation against distrust of others, and against

incredulity in general.

Kant distinguishes two forms of incredulity, which, however, are continuous

with one another. The first explicitly concerns testimony:

Incredulous1 \[ungläubisch\] is someone who accepts nothing on testimony \[unless\] it is

sufficiently

confirmed to be knowledge. \(In this case, one must make many arbitrary assumptions, so as to

be

able to make an attempt to reach certainty in knowledge.\) Commonly such a person is

suspicious

and distrustful.34

This attitude, however, is only a special case of a second, more general attitude of

incredulity: ‘Incredulous2 \[ungläubig\] is someone who does not want to accept

anything as true except on theoretically conclusive grounds.’35 Whereas incredulity

with respect to testimony is morally objectionable because it generates an attitude of

suspicion and undermines the practice of promises and social life – ‘\[w\]ithout fidelity

and belief no republique, no public affairs, would be able to exist’36 – the second,

more general form of incredulity is equally objectionable, not least because it ignores

that theoretical certainty is not always required for moral certainty; hence,

incredulity indicates a ‘lack \[Mangel\] of moral interest’37, which in turn amounts to a

self-violation of human dignity, for ‘true dignity of man rests on morality’

38.

Kant’s epistemology of testimony differs markedly from other positions in that it

balances the recipient’s perspective, which is characterised by the hearer’s desire to

have adequate justification for his testimonial beliefs, with the testifier’s perspective

and his legitimate expectation to be believed. The perhaps most explicit formulation

of a presumptive principle is to be found in the Blomberg Logic, where Kant writes39:

As for what further concerns the credibility and sincerity of witnesses who communicate

experiences they have obtained, everyone is taken to be sincere and upright until the opposite

has

been proved, namely, that he deviates from the truth etc. According to the well-known principle

of

fairness \[Billigkeit\]:

Quilibet prosumitur \[read: praesumitur\] bonus,

Donec probetur contrarium.40

The idea seems to be that, as human beings, we all are in the same epistemic

predicament of sometimes giving and sometimes receiving testimony; hence, if we

desire to be believed by other people – as we all, at times, do – we ought to also

believe the word of others. Of course Kant is not suggesting that we should always

believe everyone: Gullibility is no cure for the ills of incredulity – ‘both are equally

detrimental’.41 But some degree of trust is necessary if our epistemic position is to be

tenable and sustainable. A certain degree of faith \(fides\) in epistemic matters, and in

testimony in particular, is ‘practically-necessary’ in order to extend our reach in the

practical domain.42 To the extent that, as Kant puts it in the Vienna Logic, ‘the

prestige of our cognition is grounded above all on its practical use,’43 this practical

necessity is more than a mere de facto condition of our actual epistemic-cognitive

practices, but instead enables us to pursue our practical and epistemic goals.

The continuity of testimony with experience

It is worthwhile reflecting a little more on the kind of ‘practical necessity’ Kant has in

mind, as it is easy to misinterpret the phrase as merely an argument from the

ineliminability of testimony, which might seem a rather weak endorsement of

testimony as a source of knowledge. This, however, would be misunderstanding

Kant’s position, which is based on the thesis that historical knowledge \(that is,

knowledge based on testimony\) is the form of knowledge ‘most natural to us’44. Kant

partly bases this thesis on the empirical observation that ‘a child already has an

inclination to history and such things are easily impressed upon him’45, but it is also

supported by his view, more significantly, that testimony is wholly continuous with

experience. This continuity is not merely a continuity in content – in the sense that

some of the things of which we have experiential knowledge, we could have learnt

from testimony \(and, likewise, that we can tell others about what we have

experienced first-hand\) – but it is a continuity in kind. In one of his later Reflexionen,

Kant emphasises this epistemic continuity in kind between testimony and direct

experience: ‘Belief on testimony is neither in degree nor in kind in any way to be

distinguished from holding-to-be-true on one’s own experience.’46

One might expect that the issue of ‘immediacy’ – that is, the direct access we

enjoy with respect to our own experiences as opposed to the indirect access with
