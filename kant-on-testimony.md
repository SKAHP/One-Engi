Introduction

Immanuel Kant may seem an unlikely candidate to recruit for the cause of social

epistemology, and for the epistemology of testimony in particular. It seems fair to say

that, second perhaps only to Descartes, Kant has come to be seen as the prototypical example

of a philosopher in the ‘individualist’ tradition – that is, a tradition according to which ‘testimony

has little or no epistemic importance’

Thus, Anthony Coady, in his seminal and influential monograph Testimony: A philosophical

study \(1992\), makes no substantive reference to Kant, and even those contemporary

philosophers with a more explicit agenda of social epistemology frequently cast Kant

in the exemplary role of individualist philosopher as far as testimony is concerned.

3 Frederick Schmitt, for example, writes that ‘the way sociality enters’ into Kant’s

philosophy is such that ‘sideb is no reliance on testimony’ \(Schmitt 1987: 47\).

In the present paper, I argue that such views do not adequately reflect Kant’s position

regarding testimony. What is overlooked is that Kant does, in fact, have a well-developed

epistemology of testimony, which features most prominently in his. lectures on logic and which

gains further support from remarks he makes about testimony in his other writings. Beyond

acknowledging the ineliminability of testimony and the fact that testimony can, and frequently

does, produce knowledge, Kant argues for a continuity between testimony and experience.

Regarding its epistemic characteristics, testimonial knowledge is, Kant argues, ‘neither in

degree nor in kind in any way to be distinguished’ from knowledge based on one’s own

experience.4 This symmetry thesis, together with the additional argument that ‘incredulity’

regarding testimony shows ‘lack of moral interest’ establishes a presumptive principle regarding

the acceptance of testimony: Testimony is to be believed, unless we know that certain defeating

conditions obtain.

The mere possibility of failure of testimony, whether due to lying or mere error, does not suffice

to undermine the presumption. One important restriction does, however, apply:

‘Propositions of reason’ \(Vernunftwahrheiten\), such as moral truths, though communicable

formaliter, may not be adopted on the basis of testimony. As I shall. argue in the final section,

this points to a way of squaring Kant’s sympathy towards testimony with the strong demand for

autonomy expressed in the maxim ‘to think for oneself’. First, however, it seems appropriate to

say a little more about where in Kant’s work his epistemology of testimony is locate. Locating

Kant’s epistemology of testimony Unlike, for example, Hume, whose influential text

‘On Miracles’

6 is the standard

historical point for many contemporary papers in the epistemology of

testimony, Kant never published a fully developed, self-contained text on the subject. His

position must therefore be inferred from a variety of passages and comments scattered

throughout his work. By far the most detailed and explicit treatment of testimony in Kant’s work

is to be found in his lectures on logic. These lectures, over a period of forty years \(1755-1795\),

formed part of the core of Kant’s teaching duties at Königsberg.
