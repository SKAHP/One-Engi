Introduction

Immanuel Kant may seem an unlikely candidate to recruit for the cause of social

epistemology, and for the epistemology of testimony in particular. It seems fair to say

that, second perhaps only to Descartes, Kant has come to be seen as the prototypical example

of a philosopher in the ‘individualist’ tradition – that is, a tradition according to which ‘testimony

has little or no epistemic importance’

Thus, Anthony Coady, in his seminal and influential monograph Testimony: A philosophical

study \(1992\), makes no substantive reference to Kant, and even those contemporary

philosophers with a more explicit agenda of social epistemology frequently cast Kant

in the exemplary role of individualist philosopher as far as testimony is concerned.

3 Frederick Schmitt, for example, writes that ‘the way sociality enters’ into Kant’s

philosophy is such that ‘sideb is no reliance on testimony’ \(Schmitt 1987: 47\).

In the present paper, I argue that such views do not adequately reflect Kant’s position

regarding testimony. What is overlooked is that Kant does, in fact, have a well-developed

epistemology of testimony, which features most prominently in his. lectures on logic and which

gains further support from remarks he makes about testimony in his other writings. Beyond

acknowledging the ineliminability of testimony and the fact that testimony can, and frequently

does, produce knowledge, Kant argues for a continuity between testimony and experience.

Regarding its epistemic characteristics, testimonial knowledge is, Kant argues, ‘neither in

degree nor in kind in any way to be distinguished’ from knowledge based on one’s own

experience.4 This symmetry thesis, together with the additional argument that ‘incredulity’

regarding testimony shows ‘lack of moral interest’ establishes a presumptive principle regarding

the acceptance of testimony: Testimony is to be believed, unless we know that certain defeating

conditions obtain.

The mere possibility of failure of testimony, whether due to lying or mere error, does not suffice

to undermine the presumption. One important restriction does, however, apply:

‘Propositions of reason’ \(Vernunftwahrheiten\), such as moral truths, though communicable

formaliter, may not be adopted on the basis of testimony. As I shall. argue in the final section,

this points to a way of squaring Kant’s sympathy towards testimony with the strong demand for

autonomy expressed in the maxim ‘to think for oneself’. First, however, it seems appropriate to

say a little more about where in Kant’s work his epistemology of testimony is locate. Locating

Kant’s epistemology of testimony Unlike, for example, Hume, whose influential text

‘On Miracles’

6 is the standard

historical point for many contemporary papers in the epistemology of

testimony, Kant never published a fully developed, self-contained text on the subject. His

position must therefore be inferred from a variety of passages and comments scattered

throughout his work. By far the most detailed and explicit treatment of testimony in Kant’s work

is to be found in his lectures on logic. These lectures, over a period of forty years \(1755-1795\),

formed part of the core of Kant’s teaching duties at Königsberg.

7 Throughout, the lectures were based on Georg Friedrich Meier’s Vernunftlehre \(1752\), and in

particular on a shorter extract, the Auszug aus der Vernunftlehre, which was published the

same year. From the testimony of his students

8, it is known that Kant lectured directly from his heavily annotated copy of

the Auszug. Kant’s notes, together with the text of Meier’s Auszug, have been made

available as Volume XVI of the Academy edition, and these Reflexionen will function

as an important source of information in the following pages. Fortunately, there are

also a number of lecture notes by Kant’s students, of which several sets have been

edited and analysed in the last few decades and which span a period of several decades.

9 Finally, there is the work of Gottlob Benjamin Jäsche, whom Kant commissioned to write up

his logic as a ‘manual for lectures’. Though published in

1800, before Kant’s death, and listed, in the Academy edition, amongst Kant’s own

works, the accuracy of the Jäsche Logic is hotly contested.10 Given that more direct

accounts of Kant’s logic lectures have recently become available11, it will therefore not be relied

upon in the present paper. Despite the heavy reliance on Meier’s logic, Kant’s aim was never

purely

didactical or exegetical.

On the contrary: In an announcement for the winter semester

1765/66, Kant explains he has chosen Meier’s text because its diversity ‘gives

occasion, during the critique of reason, to also look at the critique of taste’ and to

reflect on ‘the practical and healthy understanding’.

12 Elsewhere, Kant confirms that

in his lectures, he ‘aimed at not merely commenting on the author \[...\] but at

assessing, weighing and expanding \[his argument\], and at bringing it together under principles

that to me seemed better.

’13 Also, Kant did not shy away from modifying the material he presented or correcting the

author where he saw it fit. For example,

when Meier writes that ‘faith \(fides historica\) is the approval \[Beifall\] which we give a thing on

the basis of \[someone’s\] testimony’, Kant sees this as a flaw and, according to the Vienna

Logic, argues:

Our author \[=Meier\] relates belief \[=fides\] merely to testimony

.14 We distinguish, however, between believing something and believing someone. We can

believe something without someone’s having said it to us. We can believe someone if we have

accepted something on his testimony. Proofs from experience may well show that the thing is,

but not the absolute necessity of the thing.

For experience gives only something contingent.
