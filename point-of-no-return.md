JOHN PHILLIPS MARQUAND was born

in Wilmington, Delaware, and spent most of his b4oyhood in New York

City and Newburyport, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard

College in 1915, worked for a time on the Boston Transcript, and served

as a First Lieutenant in the Field Artillery in the First World War,

participating in several offensives in France. Those who had known

him on the editorial board of the Lam poon at Harvard watched his

work with interest when he began writing serials that brought hinm

popularity and good prices in the nineteen-twenties, but it was not until

1937 that his Harvard friends saw the fulfillment of his promise in

his college days. That year THE LATE GEORGE APLEY took Boston and

the critics by storm and established Mr. Marquand's reputation as a

novelist and satirist; and in 1938 it won him the Pulitzer Prize in

fiction. Since then he has published five more full-length novels,

WICK FORD POINT, H. M. PULHAM, ESQUIRE, SO LITTLE TIME, B. F.'s

DAUGHTER, and POINT OF NO RETURN, which have established him as

one of America's top-ranking novelists. Mr. Marquand lives a good

part of the year at Newburyport, did much confidential work for the

War Department during the Second World War, and is now one of the

five judges of the Book-of-the-Month Club.

POINT OF NO RETURN

By JOHN P. MARQUAND

Charles Gray was born and brought up in Clyde

Massachusetts, which is situated on a branch line of

the Boston and Maine some thirty miles north of

Boston. In the opinion of Malcolm Bryant, social

anthropologist, Charles and his family were not

upper-upper, not even "middle-upper," just

"lower-upper." They lived on Spruce Street, not

on Johnson Street, and a maid came in only occa-

sionally to work by the hour. Charles and his

sister Dorothea went to public school, not to the

private institutions which their Johnson Street

contemporaries attended. John Gray, their father,

was regarded as irresponsible and impecunious

but his unjustified optimism, his general kindli

ness, his satirical outlook: on certain aspects of life,

and his efforts to beat what he called "the system"

gave him a charm that evoked a general disapprov-

ing sort of admiration. His failure to give point

to his life made his son Charles wish to give point

to his own, and only when it was too late did

Charles vaguely understand the forces that his

father was resisting. At that Charles was almost a

success in Clyde. He almost married Jessica Lovell,

who lived on Johnson Street and was an "upper-

upper

But all this is told in retrospect. The first part

of the novel -time a Tuesday in April 1947

deals with just one day in Charles's life. In his

early forties, he is an assistant vice-president of

the conservative Stuyvesant Bank in uptown New

York. Charles is married, has two children and

owns a modest house in a suburban town. He may

be chosen for promotion to a vice-presidential

vacancy but there is another assistant vice-president

who has the same hope. If Charles loses out he

will be too old to have much chance of future

promotion, which is good reason why his

loving but ambitious wife, Nancy, should be

harassed by the situation. The answer will come

the next Friday evening when they are to dine

with Tony Burton, the president of the bank

This combination of present and of retrospect

gives a vivid and deep picture of the vicissitudes

of small-town and middle-class American life in

the twentieth century. It is a panorama of many

lights and shadows, with a fine gallery of fully

drawn characters, among whom John Gray is per-

haps the most memorable of all the author's cre-

ations except George Apley, and it has a number

of episodes of the sort so much enjoyed by the

Marquand audience, such as the firemen's muster,

the meeting of the Confessional Club, and Charles's

mother's lecture on a once local but far from bril

liant poetess, the lecture having been written

mostly by John Gray who also had tried to train

his wife in public speaking. Here there is humor,

there is satire, there are drama and sadness, but

above all there is a universal appeal. In every

reader's life there will be a Clyde of his own.

Everyone has known a John Gray somewhere, and

everyone must reach sometime the point which

Charles reaches in this novel-a "**point of no**

**return.**

Once more Mr. Marquand has written a bril-

liant and thoughtful novel of manners in which

he again shows himself an understanding and

penetrating critic of that side of American life

which has created wealth and leisure, and a middle

class struggling for these often illusory goals.
