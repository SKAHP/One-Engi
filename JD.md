**A Lecture upon the Shadow**

BY

[JOHN DONNE](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne)

Stand still, and I will read to thee

A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.

```
     These three hours that we have spent,




     Walking here, two shadows went
```

Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.

But, now the sun is just above our head,

```
     We do those shadows tread,




     And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.
```

So whilst our infant loves did grow,

Disguises did, and shadows, flow

From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.

That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,

Which is still diligent lest others see.

Except our loves at this noon stay,

We shall new shadows make the other way.

```
     As the first were made to blind




     Others, these which come behind
```

Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.

If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,

```
     To me thou, falsely, thine,




     And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.
```

The morning shadows wear away,

But these grow longer all the day;

But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.

Love is a growing, or full constant light,

And his first minute, after noon, is night.

### Holy Sonnets: Show me dear Christ,thy spouse so bright and clear
BY **JOHN DONNE**

 ## Show me dear Christ, thy spouse so bright and clear. 
**What! is it she which on the other shore 
Goes richly painted? or which, robb'd and tore,
Laments and mourns in Germany and here? 
Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one year? 
Is she self-truth, and errs? now new, now outwore? 
Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore 
On one, on seven, or on no hill appear? 
Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights
First travel we to seek, and then make love? 
Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our sights, 
And let mine amorous soul court thy mild Dove, 
Who is most true and pleasing to thee then 
When she'is embrac'd and open to most men.*
