**1967: The Naked Ape steps out**

**12 October ON THIS DAY**

**Zoologist Dr Desmond Morris** has stunned the world by writing about humans in the same way scientists describe animals.

His new book, The Naked Ape was published today. It was so named because out of the 193 species of monkeys and apes on the planet only man is not entirely covered in hair. The former curator of mammals at London Zoo who is best known for planning to bring together Chi Chi the panda with Moscow's An An panda bear says he wants to popularise and demystify science.The provocative book sheds new light on our own behaviour and society, describing our ways of

\*\*feeding, sleeping, fighting, mating and rearing young".  
  He highlights some surprising facts that are raising quite a few eyebrows in the scientific and non-scientific world. For example:  
Homo sapiens not only has the biggest brain of all primates but also the largest penis, and is "the sexiest primate alive"  
our fleshy ear-lobes, unique to humans, are erogenous zones that have been known to provoke orgasm in both males and females,  
the more rounded shape of human breasts means they are primarily a sexual signalling device rather than simply a milk machine.

**The book has been serialised in the Daily Mirror - and with great success.  
It has already netted **£80,000** in the USA and **£70,000** in the **UK and Europe\*\*.  
But critics of the book have labelled him.  
an inadequately informed amateur  
who has oversimplified and distorted the way we behave by creating a zoological portrait of the human beinbeine  
Dr Morris and his wife are now planning to leave Britain as tax exiles after learning that the Inland Revenue are to send him a bill of £180,000.  
  He told the Daily Mail newspaper:  
The speed and timing of all this has rather shattered me. I am now faced with the situation where I shall probably be turning to writing as my major activity.  
It is pretty definite that I shall go abroad although I have not finally worked out the details."

\*\*In Context Desmond Morris began his career as head of Granada's TV and film unit at London Zoo in 1956 and went on to become curator of mammals. Soon after The Naked Ape went on sale in the UK, Desmond Morris emigrated to Malta to avoid a hefty tax bill.

The Naked Ape is first bestseller, was translated into 23 languages and was followed by many books and TV programmes on animal and social behaviour. More recently he had a regular slot commenting on the body language of contestants in Channel Four's Big Brother game show.

 . By our first strange and fatal interview,  
By all desires which thereof did ensue,  
By our long starving hopes, by that remorse  
Which my words' masculine persuasive force  
Begot in thee, and by the memory  
Of hurts, which spies and rivals threatened me,  
I calmly beg: but by thy father's wrath,  
By all pains, which want and divorcement hath,  
I conjure thee, and all the oaths which I  
And thou have sworn to seal joint constancy,  
Here I unswear, and overswear them thus,  
Thou shalt not love by ways so dangerous.  
Temper, O fair Love, love's impetuous rage,  
Be my true Mistress still, not my feigned Page;  
I'll go, and, by thy kind leave, leave behind  
Thee, only worthy to nurse in my mind  
Thirst to come back; O if thou die before,  
My soul from other lands to thee shall soar.  
Thy \(else Almighty\) beauty cannot move  
Rage from the Seas, nor thy love teach them love,  
Nor tame wild Boreas' harshness; thou hast read  
How roughly he in pieces shivered  
Fair Orithea, wbom he swore he loved.  
Fall ill or good, 'tis madness to have proved  
Dangers unurged; feed on this flattery,  
That absent Lovers one in th' other be.  
Dissemble nothing, not a boy, nor change  
Thy body's habit, nor mind's; be not strange  
To thyself only; all will spy in thy face  
A blushing womanly discovering grace;  
Ricbly clothed Apes are called Apes, and as soon  
Eclipsed as bright we call the Moon the Moon.  
Men of France, changeable chameleons,  
Spitals of diseases, shops of fashions,  
Love's fuellers, and the rightest company  
Of Players, which upon the world's stage be,  
Will quickly know thee, and no less, alas!  
Th' indifferent Italian, as we pass  
His warm land, well content to think thee Page,  
Will hunt thee with such lust, and hideous rage,  
As Lot's fair guests were vexed. But none of these  
Nor spongy hydroptic Dutch shall thee displease,  
If thou stay here. O stay here, for, for thee  
England is only a worthy gallery,  
To walk in expectation, till from thence  
Our greatest King call thee to his presence.  
When I am gone, dream me some happiness,  
Nor let thy looks our long-hid love confess,  
Nor praise, nor dispraise me, nor bless nor curse  
Openly love's force, nor in bed fright thy Nurse  
With midnight's startings, crying out—oh, oh  
Nurse, O my love is slain, I saw him go  
O'er the white Alps alone; I saw him, I,  
Assailed, fight, taken, stabbed, bleed, fall, and die.  
Augur me better chance, except dread Jove  
Think it enough for me t' have had thy love.
