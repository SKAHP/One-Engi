# Responding To The Post-truth Phenomenon

#### Monday, October 02, 2017

In 2016, the Oxford Dictionaries [declared that their Word Of The Year was to be "post-truth"](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2016), which they defined as:

> **"relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief"**

This decision reflects the way in which the concept of\_post-truth\_has quickly become a widely-acknowledged phenomenon and a mainstream concern. It should be of particular concern to those, such as librarians, with a professional interest in the provision of access to accurate information.

The natural response to this issue is to press for a greater awareness of and education in_information literacy_, and this is certainly an important consideration. However, a wider range of technical and practical issues in knowledge organisation and information management can also be brought to bear on this.

Much of the attention and effort from the DCMI community over the last two decades has been concerned with the development of technologies and practices to use metadata to improve the precision and accuracy of information.

How should the metadata community respond to the rise of the\_post-truth\_phenomenon? Does metadata have a part to play in helping people to identify objectively accurate information?

The DCMI community ought to have a view on this and so, in order to help us develop this, we are pleased to announce that [David Clarke](https://davidclarke.blog/) will present and moderate a plenary session, [_Developing a Metadata Community Response to the Post-Truth Information Age_](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/index/pages/view/sp17-postTruth)at the DCMI 2017 conference, where delegates will have the chance to explore and discuss this issue in depth.

It is not too late to [register for DCMI 2017](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/index/pages/view/reg17)!

**Venue:TBA**

## **SESSION ABSTRACT**

Post-truth issues are adversely affecting people all around the world. The metadata and knowledge organization communities have a mission to help people access information that is as objective, comprehensive and as relevant as possible. This session is an open invitation to members of our community to engage with these issues, contribute ideas for solutions, and consider whether DCMI has a potential role to play in charting a path forward.

In 2016 the Oxford English Dictionary chose ‘post-truth’ as word of the year. Their decision was based on the proliferation of fake news stories and misinformation that accompanied both the US national election and the British EU referendum. On Earth Day in April 2017 thousands of people gathered in London for a March for Science, protesting the negative impact of post-truth culture and politics on science, research and education.

How can the metadata community engage with, and respond to, these issues? In this session, David Clarke will describe the problem space and comment on the issues from the perspective of knowledge organization and information science. The session will include ample time for delegate participation, including a discussion about how the metadata community can get involved and contribute ideas for solutions.

## **BACKGROUND**

[![](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/public/dc-images/YouTube.png)](https://youtu.be/EBczv-aiIbs)

**Post-truth embraces several distinct concepts with different causes and effects**. Fake news is the most talked-about manifestation of post–truth. Fake news describes false information that is presented to look like news stories. _Fake news_ includes: **\(i\) playful hoaxes and satirical content; \(ii\) opinion-based content that may represent the sincere beliefs of its authors, but which nevertheless conveys misinformation; and \(iii\) disinformation, which differs from misinformation in that it is deliberately disseminated to deceive its target audience. An alarming form of disinformation in social media is ‘socialbots’, which can automatically generate thousands of artificial messages in support of, or opposition to, political candidates and causes. They distort human democratic discourse and have influenced recent elections. **

_A second manifestatio_n of post-truth is commonly referred to as the filter bubble, which is a consequence of personalized search. Traditional search methods use relevancy-based processes in which user queries are searched against keywords in documents and their metadata. In personalized search, however, a query is only partially based upon the user query and the content, a substantial amount of additional filtering is performed using personal profile data about the user’s past preferences and behaviors as well as demographic data. Personalized search means that different people may retrieve significantly different search results when they input the same question. The technique was originally developed to enhance online shopping experiences, where it has proved to be very successful. When the same techniques are applied to the retrieval of news and general knowledge, however, they can distort people’s sense of reality. Eli Pariser described the problem in his 2012 book called_The Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web is Changing What We Read and How We Think_:

> "Left to their own devices, personalization filters serve up a kind of autopropaganda, indoctrinating us with our own ideas, amplifying our desire for things that are familiar… In the filter bubble, there’s less room for the chance encounters that bring insight and learning…".

_A third manifestation _of post-truth concerns sponsored content, the ability of advertisers to pay to promote content in search engine results or to deliver messages via social media, both of which can be selectively disseminated to precisely defined audience segments. Advertising and sponsored results for search queries about products and services is universally practiced and widely accepted. A disturbing post-truth phenomenon is that sponsored content is also being disseminated for search queries about general knowledge and news. If a vested interest wants to influence public opinion about a topic like climate change or a particular taxation policy then they can pay to ensure their content rises to the top. Unlike print and broadcast media political advertising on the Internet is unregulated. Political campaign managers in the USA and UK described micro-targeted messaging via social media as decisive in recent elections. For democracy to work, people need access to objective and trustworthy information.

_A fourth issue in_ the post-truth problem space is information-literacy. For a large and growing percentage of the population web search engines and social media have become the primary source for news and general information. These platforms aggregate content from many different sources, including authoritative content and fact-checked news stories, as well as opinion-based content and disinformation. **A paradox of the Information Age** is that while we have access to many more and diverse information sources, it is getting **harder to determine the origin and authenticity of information,** to distinguish fact from opinion and truth from lies.
