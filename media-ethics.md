The playful wit and sharp mind of Socrates attracted disciples from all across an

cient Greece. They came to learn and debate in what could be translated "his

thinkery" By shifting the disputes among Athenians over earth, air, fire and water to

human virtue, Socrates gave Western philosophy and ethics a new intellectual cen

ter \(Cassier 1944\) But sometimes his relentless arguments would go nowhere. On one occasion

he sparred with the philosopher Hippias about the difference between truth and

falsehood. Hippias was worn into submission, but retorted at the end: "I cannot

agree with you, Socrates." And then the master concluded: "Nor I with myself, Hip-

I go astray, up and down, and never hold the same opinion." Socrates ad

mitted to being so clever that he had befuddled himself. No wonder he was a favorite

target of the comic poets. **I. F. Stone** likens this wizardry to

**"whales of the intellect flailing about in deep seas"** \(Stone 1988\)

With his young friend, Meno, Socrates argued whether virtue is teachable.

Meno was eager to learn more, after "holding forth often on the subject in front of large audiences." But he complained,

"You are exercising magic and witchcraft upon me and positively laying me under your spell until I am just

a mass of helpessness.. . You are exactly like the flat stingray that one meets in the sea. When

ever anyone comes into contact with it, it numbs him, and that is the sort of thing

you seem to be doing to me now. My mind and my lips are literally numb

**Philosophy is not a semantic game**, though sometimes its **idiosyncracies **feed

that response into the popular mind. Media Ethics: Issues and Cases does not de

bunk philosophy as the excess of sovercign reason. The authors of this book will not

encourage those who ridicule philosophy as cunning rhetoric. The issue at stake

here is actually a somewhat different problem the Cartesian model of philoso-

phizing.

**The founder of modern philosophy, Ren√© Descartes**  preferred to work in solitude.

Paris was whirling in the early seventeenth century, but for two years even

Descartes's nds could not find him as he squirreled away studying mathematics.

One can even guess the motto above his desk: "**Happy is he who lives in seclusion."**

Imagine the conditions under which who wrote meditation II.

The Thirty Years' War in Europe brought social chaos everywhere. The Spanish were ravaging the French

provinces and even threatening Paris, but Descartes was shut away in an apartment

in Holland. Tranquility for philosophical speculation mattered so much to him that

upon hearing Galileo had been condemned by the Church, he retracted parallel ar-

guments of his own on natural science. Pure philosophy as an abstract enterprise

needed a cool atmosphere isolated from everyday events.

**Descartes's magnificent formulations have always had their detractors**, of

course. David Hume did not think of philosophy in those terms, believing as he did

that **sentiment is the foundation of morality**. For Seren Kierkegaard, an abstract system of ethics is

only paper currency with nothing to back it up. Karl Marx insisted

that we change the world and not merely explain it. But no one drew the modern

philosophical map more decisively than Descartes, and his mode of rigid inquiry has

generally defined the field's parameters.

This book adopts the historical perspective suggested by Stephen Toulmin:
