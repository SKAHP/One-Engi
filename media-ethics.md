The playful wit and sharp mind of Socrates attracted disciples from all across an

thinkery" By shifting the disputes among Athenians over earth, air, fire and water to

human virtue, Socrates gave Western philosophy and ethics a new intellectual cen

But sometimes his relentless arguments would go nowhere. On one occasion

he sparred with the philosopher Hippias about the difference between truth and

falsehood. Hippias was worn into submission, but retorted at the end: "I cannot

agree with you, Socrates." And then the master concluded: "Nor I with myself, Hip-

I go astray, up and down, and never hold the same opinion." Socrates ad

target of the comic poets. I. F. Stone likens this wizardry to "whales of the intellect

flailing about in deep seas" \(Stone 1988\)

With his young friend, Meno, Socrates argued whether virtue is teachable.

Meno was eager to learn more, after "holding forth often on the subject in front of

large audiences." But he complained, "You are exercising magic and witc

Philosophy is not a semantic game, though sometimes its idiosyncracies feed

that response into the popular mind. Media Ethics: Issues and Cases does not de

bunk philosophy as the excess of sovercign reason. The authors of this book will not

encourage those who ridicule philosophy as cunning rhetoric. The issue at stake
