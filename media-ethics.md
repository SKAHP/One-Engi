The playful wit and sharp mind of Socrates attracted disciples from all across ancient Greece. They came to learn and debate in what could be translated "his thinkery" By shifting the disputes among Athenians over earth, air, fire and water to human virtue, Socrates gave Western philosophy and ethics a new intellectual center \(Cassier 1944\) But sometimes his relentless arguments would go nowhere. On one occasion he sparred with the philosopher Hippias about the difference between truth andfalsehood. Hippias was worn into submission, but retorted at the end: "I cannot agree with you, Socrates." And then the master concluded: **"Nor I with myself, Hip- go astray, up and down, and never hold the same opinion."** Socrate dmitted to being so clever that he had befuddled himself. No wonder he was a favorite arget of the comic poets. **I. F. Stone** likens this wizardry to  
**"whales of the intellect flailing about in deep seas"** \(Stone 1988\)  
With his young friend, Meno, **Socrates argued whether virtue is teachable.**  
Meno was eager to learn more, after **"holding forth often on the subject in front of large audiences." **But he complained,  
**"You are exercising magic and witchcraft upon me and positively laying me under your spell until I am just  
a mass of helpessness.. . You are exactly like the flat stingray that one meets in the sea. When  
ever anyone comes into contact with it, it numbs him, and that is the sort of thing  
you seem to be doing to me now. My mind and my lips are literally numb    
**Philosophy is not a semantic game**, though sometimes its **idiosyncracies feed  
that response into the popular mind. \*\*Media Ethics: Issues and Cases does not de  
bunk philosophy as the excess of sovercign reason. The authors of this book will not  
encourage those who ridicule philosophy as cunning rhetoric. The issue at stake  
here is actually a somewhat different problem the Cartesian model of philosophizing.

**The founder of modern philosophy, René Descartes**  preferred to work in solitude. **Paris was whirling in the early seventeenth century, but for two years even **Descartess nds could not find him as he squirreled away studying mathematics.  
**One can even guess the motto above his desk: "**Happy is he who lives in seclusion."**    
**Imagine the conditions under which who wrote meditation II.

**The Thirty Years' War in Europe brought social chaos everywhere. The Spanish were ravaging the French    
**provinces and even threatening Paris, but Descartes was shut away in an apartment  
in Holland. Tranquility for philosophical speculation mattered so much to him that  
upon hearing Galileo had been condemned by the Church, he retracted parallel ar-  
guments of his own on natural science. Pure philosophy as an abstract enterprise  
needed a cool atmosphere isolated from everyday events.

**Descartes's magnificent formulations have always had their detractors**, of  
course. David Hume did not think of philosophy in those terms, believing as he did  
that **sentiment is the foundation of morality**. For Seren Kierkegaard, **an abstract system of ethics is  
only paper currency with nothing to back it up**. Karl Marx insisted  
that **we change the world and not merely explain it.** But no one drew the modern  
philosophical map more **decisively than Descartes,** and his **mode of rigid inquiry** has  
generally **defined the field's parameters**.This book adopts the historical perspective suggested by **Stephen Toulmin**:

### The philosophy whose legitimacy the critics challenge is always the seventeenth

century tradition founded primarily upon René Descartes. \[The\] arguments are  
**directed to one particular style of philosophizing-a theory-centered style** which poses  
philosophical problems, and frames solutions to them, in timeless and universal terms  
**From 1650, this particular style was taken as defining the very agenda of philosophy  
\(1988, 338\) **

The seventeenth-century philosophers set aside the particular, the timely, the local and the oral.  
And that development left untouched nearly half of the philosophical agenda.

### Indeed, it is those neglected topics-what I here call "practical philosophy"- that are

**showing fresh signs of life today, at the very time when the more familiar "theory-**centered half of the subject is languishing.

\(Toulmin 1988, 338\)

This book collaborates in demolishing the barrier of three centuries between
pure and applied philosophy: it joins in reentering practical concerns as the legiti-
mate domain of philosophy itself. For Toulmin, the primary locus of ethics has
moved from the study to the bedside, to criminal courts, engineering labs, the news-
room, factories and the ethnic street corners. Moral philosophers are not being asked
to hand over their duties to technical experts in today's institutions, but rather to
fashion their agenda within the conditions of contemporary struggle
All humans have a theoretical capacity. Critical thinking, the reflective dimen-
sion, is our common property. And this book nurtures that reflection in communica-
tion classrooms and by extension into centers of media practice. If the mind is like
a muscle, this volume provides a regimen of exercises for strengthening its powers
of systematic reflection and moral discernment. It does not permit those aimless ar-
guments that result in quandary ethics. Instead it operates in the finest traditions of
practical philosophy, anchoring the debates in real-life conundrums but pushing the
discussion toward substantive issues and integrating appropriate theory into the
decision-making process. It seeks to empower students to do ethics themselves,
under the old adage that teaching someone to fish lasts a lifetime, and providing fish
only saves the day.
Media Ethics: Issues and Cases arrives on the scene at a strategic time in highereducation. Since the late nineteenth century, ethical questions have been taken from
the curriculum as a whole and from the philosophy department. Recovering practical philosophy 
has involved a revolution during the last decade in which courses in professional ethics have reappeared throughout the curriculum. This book advocates the pervasive method and carries the discussions even further, beyond freestanding
courses into communication classrooms across the board.
In this sense, the book represents a constructive response to the current debates
over the mission of higher education. Professional ethics has long been saddled with
the dilemma that the university was given responsibility for professional training
precisely at the point in its history that it turned away from values to scientific nat-
uralism. Today one sees it as a vast horizontal plain given to technical excellence but
barren in enabling students to articulate a philosophy of life. As James Carey concludes

Higher education has not-been performing well of late and, like most American

institutions, is suffering from a confusion of purpose, an excess of ambition that  
borders on hubris, and an appetite for money that is truly alarming. \(1989, 48\)  
The broadside critiques leveled in Thorstein Veblen's The Higher Learning in  
America \(1918\) and Upton Sinclair's The Goose Step \(1922\) are now too blatantly  
obvious to ignore. But Media Ethics: Issues and Cases does not merely demand a better general  
education or a recommitment to values; it strengthens the communications curriulum.
