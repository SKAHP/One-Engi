Frank Holeman

Washington, D.C. 

June 9, 1987

Niel M. Johnson

\[1\]

JOHNSON: Mr. Holeman, I'm going to begin by asking you to tell us when and where you were born, and what your parents' names are.

HOLEMAN: I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, June 23, 1920. My father's name was James Holeman, and my mother's name was Dixie Hester Holeman.

JOHNSON: And that's where you were educated?

HOLEMAN: I went to public schools in Raleigh, and then I went to the University of North Carolina; graduated in June of 1940 with a BA in Journalism.

JOHNSON: Then what happened?

HOLEMAN: Then I went to New York and starved to death for

\[2\]

nine months or a year, and finally got a job as a copy boy on the New YorkDaily News.

JOHNSON: And that lasted until...

HOLEMAN: Well, I was sent to Washington on Memorial Day, 1942 as a cub reporter on a theory that I would never be drafted. I worked here for about six months as a reporter; then my Brooklyn draft board heard about my situation, and I was promptly drafted. I went away in January of '43 and came back January of '46.

JOHNSON: But you were here in '42, here in Washington, D.C.

HOLEMAN: Six months of '42. The last six months.

JOHNSON: Did you cover the Roosevelt White House at all?

HOLEMAN: Well, I was in and out. I was just a kid reporter. I was given, eventually, a White House card. I went to the press conferences upon sufferance; you had to stand in the back and say nothing.

JOHNSON: But in the Oval office at the White House?

HOLEMAN: Yes.

\[3\]

JOHNSON: And I suppose you were impressed with Roosevelt's handling of the press?

HOLEMAN: Well, yes, but again, I was impressed by everything. I was twenty-three years old.

JOHNSON: Except by the Army, maybe.

HOLEMAN: Oh, yes, I didn't care much for that.

JOHNSON: What kind of service did you have then?

HOLEMAN: I was six feet eight and weighed 150. That shows you how black things were in those days; they drafted me. So they eventually threw me into the Medics. But I got out of there, and served most of the time in the Counter-Intelligence Corps in the Pacific. I was eventually assigned to the 214th Counter-Intelligence Corps Detachment with the headquarters of the XIV Corps. My own outfit went from Brisbane, Australia to Sydney, Australia and back up to Bougainville in the Solomon Islands where we joined the XIV Corps. Then we went on up to the Lingayen operation, landed on Luzon, and then to the occupation of Japan. I had the grand tour.

\[4\]

JOHNSON: Did you ever get to see the U.S.S.Missouriwhile you were out there?

HOLEMAN: Well, not then, no. We were in a little town of San Jose, Neuva Eicja on Luzon when the war ended. We went from there, and on about September 14 we landed in Sendai, northern Japan. It's on the Island of Honshu, but it's north. I saw theMissourilater; coming back from Rio \[de Janeiro\] I was on theMissouri.

JOHNSON: You were on theMissouriwhen it went to Rio?

HOLEMAN: We flew down, and came back on theMissouri.

JOHNSON: I see. Do you have any recollection of August 14, 1945?

HOLEMAN: Oh yes, everybody does. The night that the Japanese surrender offer was announced, we were watching a movie; you know, an outdoor movie around a tent hospital. The movie went off and the lights came up, and they said, "This is Major Reginald Jackson, Public Relations Officer, XIV Corps. United Press has just carried a flash; Japan has offered to surrender." The question was whether we would take it, and let the Emperor remain

\[5\]

and all of this. I never will forget, there was a sonofabitch named Kilgore, who was a Senator from West Virginia, and who did not want to stop the war. He wanted us to keep fighting.

JOHNSON: Harley Kilgore?

HOLEMAN: I forget what his name was, but he went to see Truman, told him not to accept this offer, because half of his state was in war plants, you see.

JOHNSON: I hadn't heard that one before.

HOLEMAN: Well, it's true. All you've got to do is look at the newspapers at the time.

JOHNSON: How about April 12th, when Roosevelt died?

HOLEMAN: Well, I was in the hospital again, on April 12, down in a little place just south of Manila. Everybody got sick two or three times. This time I had jaundice. I never will forget; there came a notice on the loudspeaker, "We have just received word"--whatever source it was--"that President Roosevelt has died." And the guy in the bed next to me said, "Slim, I don't believe that shit, do you?" Nobody could believe that Roosevelt was dead.

\[6\]

JOHNSON: Thought he was immortal, huh?

HOLEMAN: Well, he had been alive all our time. He had been running the country for all the time we were grown.

JOHNSON: I suppose they said, "Harry Who?"

HOLEMAN: Well, we hadn't gotten around to him yet.

JOHNSON: When you heard the bombing, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, what was the reaction?

HOLEMAN: Well, we were all for anything that would end the war. You see, our outfit, we already knew, was slated for what was going to be called operation Coronet, which was the invasion of the main islands of Japan. We had been weighed and measured and assigned ships. So the first landing, as we understood it, was going to be a landing on Kyushu, which is a southern island, but that was a feint. The main assault was going to come on the Kanto Plain, just around Tokyo, and the XIV Corps was in there.

JOHNSON: You were in Counter-Intelligence?

HOLEMAN: Yes, but we were attached...

\[7\]

JOHNSON: So you had more information than most.

HOLEMAN: No, no. We didn't have any. You know, we just had scuttlebutt. This could all be checked somewhere, but we believe that was the case. We knew we had been weighed, how many pounds and how many cubic feet, and assigned ships. So we were going to be in on the invasion, and we were the boys who were going to get hit.

JOHNSON: When did you come back then to the States?

HOLEMAN: We left Sendai in November, and forty days later, on Christmas Eve of '45, we landed in Galveston. We came on an empty Liberty ship, with their merchant gun crews, you know. Only 14 GIs were on it; we had a wonderful trip home.

JOHNSON: Did you go around the tip of South Africa?

HOLEMAN: No, through the Canal.

JOHNSON: Sendai.

HOLEMAN: It's a town about like Baltimore, north of Tokyo. It's in Tohoku Prefecture; it's the site of the University of Sendai.

\[8\]

JOHNSON: When did you get your discharge?

HOLEMAN: January 1, 1946, at Fort Bragg. I couldn't get out fast enough.

JOHNSON: What did you do then?

HOLEMAN: Immediately back to the Washington Bureau of theNews. I had gotten a letter, after the surrender, from the head of the Washington Bureau, saying did I want to come back to the Bureau, or go to New York. I said I would like very much to come back to the Bureau. So they let me back.

JOHNSON: Where were you located here in Washington with the Bureau?

HOLEMAN: In Room 1272 of the National Press Building.

JOHNSON: The building we're in right now.

HOLEMAN: Yes.

JOHNSON: What was your first job then?

HOLEMAN: Well, the first hearing I covered was a hearing where Averell Harriman went up on the Hill. He was

\[9\]

then Secretary of Commerce, I think. I went up, wrote the story, scared to death. But the woman who was running the Bureau that day, Ruth Montgomery, was very kind to me. She cleared the thing through and just said, "It's too damn long," but nothing outside of that. So I was back in business.

JOHNSON: That was your first article.

HOLEMAN: After returning home from the war. I had written for six months before getting into the war. I covered the Battle of Midway, from Constitution Avenue, you know, from communiqu√©s.

JOHNSON: So Harriman was the first Truman appointee that you really got familiar with.

HOLEMAN: Covered, yes.

JOHNSON: What was your primary job?

HOLEMAN: We had a roving assignment system. The news editor of the Bureau, whose name was Ted Lewis, would look at the lineup of stories coming up today, and say, "Well, we're going to cover the top five, or four." Then he would

\[10\]

pick those men. There was a man-to-man coverage, as they say in football; follow the story wherever it went.

JOHNSON: Who else worked with you for the New YorkDaily News?

HOLEMAN: The head of the Bureau was John O'Donnell, who was a columnist. He wrote a column called "Capitol Stuff;" the news editor was Edward Lewis, known as Ted. All these people are dead. The military editor was Jerry Greene, who is also dead. The State Department--we didn't have a regular man over there at that time, but later we got a guy from the UPI named Mike O'Neill, who is still alive. Paul Healy was a good, general, all-purpose man; he was a great personality-profile writer. He's, unfortunately, dead. Gwen Gibson came after the Eisenhower heart attack.

JOHNSON: Gwen Gibson.

HOLEMAN: She came from Denver where she had made an impression on people with her work for the United Press on the Eisenhower illness. I'm trying to think. The woman was Ruth Montgomery. She's still alive; she's still here.

JOHNSON: So you rotated, and you were covering State, and the War Department, and the Congress.

\[11\]

HOLEMAN: Congress and Defense, and the White House occasionally. Investigations were great in those days, you know. Truman's old committee was kept going under the Republicans, under Senator Homer Ferguson, investigating Howard Hughes and all of that stuff. I had some of that.

JOHNSON: Do you recall when you first met Truman, the President?

HOLEMAN: Yes. Well, we're talking about covered. He, as I say, he would not know me now if he appeared. He might remember having seen me someplace.

JOHNSON: Because you stood out.

HOLEMAN: Yes, that's right, but we were never buddy-buddy. I was not one of his friends; he did not like my newspaper, or any of the rest of it. I was just one of the guys that followed along, one of the king's bastards that went on the back of the train. It would be a trip like Christmas of '46, or it could have been the 4th of July of '46, when they needed some one to cover. Married people didn't want to leave home, and off I went.

JOHNSON: Did you remain a bachelor all those years?

\[12\]

HOLEMAN: All that time, up until '57. I got married in '57. During all the Truman years I was a bachelor.

JOHNSON: I think he flew out to Independence in 1946 in bad weather, very bad weather, and he got a kind of a bad press from that.

HOLEMAN: Well, I'm not sure whether I was on that flight or not, but I was on several when lightning struck the plane, and you know, balls of fire rolled from one end to the other, and everybody reached for a drink. This was before jets you understand. TWA had all of the charters. Tom Bell, who is still probably around here, ran the charters--the TWA charters.

JOHNSON: You chartered the plane that followed the President's plane?

HOLEMAN: The White House chartered the press plane, that followed the President.

JOHNSON: So you followed the President.

HOLEMAN: And they billed us individually. They would fill up the crew with some leftovers from the White House, like Secret Service men. So there would be two

\[13\]

poker games; there would be the reporters' poker game and then there would be a Secret Service poker game.

JOHNSON: So that's what you did when you were flying behind the President, playing poker.

HOLEMAN: That's right.

JOHNSON: When lightning was hitting the plane, you were...

HOLEMAN: We were drinking as fast as we could go, I'll tell you.

JOHNSON: That must have been some experience, to be flying behind the President in those days.

HOLEMAN: Well, it was much nicer than it is now they tell me. One or two guys are still over there who were around in those days, and they say it is altogether different.

JOHNSON: Doesn't have the same ambience, or feeling?

HOLEMAN: Well, they've got too many people over there. They've got not only one plane; they've got two or three planes, and everybody is out shooting the President, you know, trying to get a Pulitzer Prize in one week

\[14\]

JOHNSON: Can you recall when your first big story appeared concerning the President?

HOLEMAN: No, I can't because there's only one big story that I remember theNewsever getting from Truman, and that was by Paul Healy who was down at Deerfoot Lake when Truman said he would not give the atom bomb to the Russians. And our guy got away from the crowd and found a telephone someplace.

JOHNSON: Paul Healy?

HOLEMAN: Yes. Now you may find six other guys claiming credit for the same big scoop, but he's the guy that got a bonus for it from my paper.

JOHNSON: So that was a New YorkDaily Newsscoop.

HOLEMAN: A scoop in those days--fifteen minutes was big stuff.

JOHNSON: Do you recall the first news conference in the Oval office that you attended?

HOLEMAN: I can't really pick out one. It didn't make all that much of an impression.

\[15\]

JOHNSON: But you started going to the Oval Office for the press conferences in 1946.

HOLEMAN: Yes, standing up. You know, we all stood up in those days.

JOHNSON: Then they switched over to the Indian Treaty Room.

HOLEMAN: That was Eisenhower. My recollection is Eisenhower.

JOHNSON: But it actually started later in the Truman period.

HOLEMAN: Maybe I'm getting the television thing. You see, they filmed Eisenhower in the Indian Treaty Room.

JOHNSON: They televised it?

HOLEMAN: Not live. They filmed it; they kinescoped it, or whatever they did. Then if Hagerty liked it he let it go, if he didn't he had the right to censor it. He never did, but...

JOHNSON: But they didn't do that with Truman; they didn't do any kinescopes?

HOLEMAN: I don't believe so. Now, again, nobody's memory is perfect, but I don't think so. I think it was Q and

\[16\]

A, and you got a transcript, page at a time, fast from the White House stenographer, not Jack Romagna, but some firm that they hired, that they gave rights to these press conferences to.

JOHNSON: You knew Romagna?

HOLEMAN: Oh yes.

JOHNSON: What kind of a person was he?

HOLEMAN: Very fine guy. I played chess with him many times. He learned chess on the run. He also used to play the organ. He was a great Bach...

JOHNSON: Played Bach.

HOLEMAN: Well, I'm not a musician, but he would go to the chapel at some base or wherever we were, and play the organ. He got into a little problem when the Kennedys came in, and he disappeared. A committee of reporters waited on Salinger and said, "What have you done to my Romagna?" And he said, "Well, you don't want to know."

JOHNSON: He didn't work for Eisenhower did he, or did he?

HOLEMAN: Sure he did. He worked all through Eisenhower.

\[17\]

He started with Roosevelt, then with Truman and Eisenhower.

JOHNSON: He seemed to be a pretty meticulous recorder.

HOLEMAN: He was a very competent, able guy, and a pleasant, agreeable person. But he had some other problems we didn't know about at the time.

JOHNSON: How about Ross, Charlie Ross: Do you remember him?

HOLEMAN: Yes, oh sure. We were in the Muehlebach Hotel one night; it was about three in the morning, and everybody had gone to bed. Carroll Linkins, the Western Union man, rousted everybody up, called every room, got them up. "Mr. Ross says come to the Press Room right away." So we went down there and Ross had had a few of these \[drinks\], and he said, "There isn't any news boys; let's just have a poker game--Grand Old Game, GOG." That was seven card high-low, and Ross called it "GOG--Grand Old Game."

JOHNSON: This was at the Muehlebach, in Kansas City.

HOLEMAN: The Muehlebach, yes, that's right.

JOHNSON: About when would that have happened?

\[18\]

HOLEMAN: Well, Ross was only there a few...

JOHNSON: He was there up to December '50, when he died of a heart attack.

HOLEMAN: Right, it was sometime between '48 and '50.

JOHNSON: Of course, the '48 campaign was a big event for news people.

HOLEMAN: Yes. Well, I didn't do much on that. I covered, believe it or not, Earl Warren's campaign for Vice President. It was the best campaign I ever saw. This was the last of the good trains; went all the way across the country on it. He couldn't lose. Everybody was out to see him; he was a nice fellow. So we had a wonderful time. But then Truman made a speech up in the Brooklyn Academy of Music about Friday night before election. The election was on Tuesday. So they assigned me to pick up Truman at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and go with him to St. Louis where he had a speech Saturday night.

JOHNSON: Kiel Auditorium, I suppose.

HOLEMAN: Yes. Downtown, big auditorium. That was one time I really got lost. I was afraid I was going to

\[19\]

miss the goddamn train. Then I went with him on to Kansas City for the election.

JOHNSON: You say you covered Warren, until you picked up Truman the last day or two. What impressed you as to their styles, or did anything kind of strike you at the time as to whether Truman had a chance to win that election?

HOLEMAN: Nobody thought Truman had a chance. Otherwise I wouldn't have been on that train. They'd have had a real honest to god hard-working reporter, see. One of the big guys. I'll tell you what happened. We got to St. Louis. It was a Saturday, and the custom was for the White House to put out excerpts, you know, two or three new paragraphs that the President was going to use in a regular speech, so he could put a new top on it for Sunday papers. All right, this is Saturday; the subject, I forget what it was, something pretty mundane. Anyway, we get into the hall and Truman tears the damn speech up and lights into my publishers. I mean the McCormick-Patterson axis, you know.

JOHNSON: Oh, you were a McCormick paper?

\[20\]

HOLEMAN: Patterson. Well, they both owned the papers together. I worked for the New York end of the axis. He denounced hell out of them, see. Not only I had to write a new story, but everybody else did. That's why I almost missed the train and got caught up in this mob, but some Secret Service guys rescued me and took me out of there. You know, they're looking for stragglers anyway. They were pretty high-class guys. They got me onto the train, and we went on to Kansas City. We were going across Missouri, and we're all sitting around and relaxing, and Tony Vacarro says, "You know, with a staff like this, Robert E. Lee couldn't carry Virginia." Well, that's what we thought of Truman's chances. He didn't think he was going to win. If you go back to a speech he made at a Masonic dinner on a Monday, again in the Muehlebach, he gave them a real off-the-cuff speech about how glad he would be to get out of that "great white jail." That's what he called it, a big white jail. He let his hair down.

So the next morning we went with him to vote, and it was a kind of drizzly day, not pouring rain, but just gloomy. And we said, "Mr. President, how do you think

\[21\]

it's going to come out?" He said, "It can't be anything but victory." Then he and Vivian went off somewhere and you know all of that story. We got on the train, and he came through, woke everybody up as we were headed to St. Louis.

JOHNSON: After the election.

HOLEMAN: Yes, this was on the way home, a couple of days after the election, after everybody had settled down. We asked him, somebody asked him, "Mr. President, did you really think you were going to win this damn election?" He just grinned and he said, "Well, I'll tell you this." And in effect he said, "I thought I had a chance." He said, "I was an underdog in every race I ever ran in Missouri. They said I couldn't win, but I managed it." He talked about his "non-political trip" around the country to the West Coast.

JOHNSON: The 1948 non-political trip.

HOLEMAN: The crowds impressed him. He said that people told him they were just coming out to see a President, but he thought it might be more than that. He thought

\[22\]

he had a chance, but all this stuff about a certain winner, that's a lot of bull shit.

JOHNSON: On election night you were in Kansas City. Where were you staying?

HOLEMAN: We were in the Muehlebach. None of us slept a wink that night, because this thing began to turn around a little bit. And Ross--I never will forget him sitting in the coffee shop of the Muehlebach about 4 or 5 in the morning, and he said, "We don't say that we're going to win this election, but it's going to be a lot closer than anybody ever thought. And win, lose or draw, there's a lot of sonsofbitches we don't have to be nice to any more." About that time the manager of the hotel, Barney Allis comes in with telegrams. All of the big stars of the media in those days were saying they want a room, they want a room, they're moving from the Roosevelt in New York, they're coming to Kansas City, and they want to be taken care of. "Dear Barney, I need a room." "I need two rooms."

JOHNSON: To join the winner?

HOLEMAN: Yes. Barney says, "Mr. Ross, I'm getting all
